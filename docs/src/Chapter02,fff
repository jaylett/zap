\C{Installing} Installation: making sure everything's in the right place

Zap is a fairly complex application, and while you \e{can} just copy it onto
your hard disc, it is better if you set it up properly. This will only take
a couple of minutes, and has a number of benefits (although you won't notice
them directly - you just won't get irritated by some of the things that can
go wrong if you \e{don't} set it up properly).

Unfortunately there is no upgrade path from earlier versions of Zap, because
both the configuration and the layout of files within Zap itself have
altered. We apologise for the inconvenience this causes.

\H{archives} Getting the right files

Zap comes in a number of parts. Which parts you need will depend on what
you're intending to do.

Firstly there is the core distribution, which contains merely those
files \e{required} to get Zap running. While this will give you a usable
text editor, it will be missing many of the more sophisticated features
described in this manual.

Secondly there is a group of extensions which is \e{recommended}; you don't
need these to run Zap, but they provide lots of useful features which you
will probably want.

Thirdly, there are some \e{optional} extensions which many people won't
need, but which some people will find useful.

The core distribution is supplied in one archive, \c{zap.zip}. This is the
first thing you should set up; this process is described below in \k{core
setup}.

The recommended extensions are also supplied in one archive, \c{zmods1.zip}.
Once you've set up Zap itself, you can install these; see \k{recommended
setup} below.

The following additional archives are optional:

\b \c{zfonts.zip} - a full \i{ZapFonts} distribution, containing lots and
lots of fonts. Generally you don't need this for Zap; however ZapFonts is
used by some other applications, so you may want the additional fonts for
use with them. See \k{zapfonts} below for more information.

\b \c{zmods2.zip} - several more extensions. As new extensions appear, they
will usually be added in here rather than making \c{zmods1.zip} any bigger
(unless they are considered to be incredibly useful). See \k{optional setup}
below for more information.

\H{core setup} Core setup

The Zap core distribution contains an Install file (this document in text
format), and the \c{!Zap} application directory. Please don't just copy it
onto your hard disc - this is extremely limiting.

As well as the Zap application, the core distribution contains two support
files, a stripped\-down copy of ZapFonts, and a copy of \i{ZapUser}. In the
archive, they are both \e{inside} the \c{!Zap} application directory. What
you should do is to copy \c{!Zap} into wherever you want it, and then move
both ZapFonts (the \c{!ZapFonts} application directory) and ZapUser (the
\c{!ZapUser} application directory) out of it. To do this, hold down shift
and double\-click on the \c{!Zap} icon. This will open a directory viewer;
you can move things out by holding down shift and dragging the icons out to
where you want them to go.

Now let's look at where they should be going. We'll deal with ZapUser first.

\S{zapuser} \i{ZapUser}: user configuration files

ZapUser is designed to keep all your preferences and settings in one place.
This means that you can copy it onto a floppy disc, take it to another
computer, and have exactly the settings that you want there too.

To make this work, we don't really want ZapUser hiding away inside the Zap
directory, and fortunately there is a better place. If you have a
RISCPC\-style boot structure (as most people do - see below if you don't),
then you want to put ZapUser in \c{Boot:Choices} (shift double\-click on
\c{!Boot} on your main hard disc, and then double\-click on Choices in the
directory viewer that come up; then you can move the \c{!ZapUser}
application by shift\-dragging).

If you \e{don't} have a RISCPC\-style boot structure, then you have a choice.
If you have a boot structure then you can try to find a place to put ZapUser
in that, so that it will get booted \e{before} Zap (wherever you put Zap).
If you can't do that, or don't know what it means, then it's best to keep
ZapUser living inside Zap. While that's far from ideal, it's a lot easier
than setting up a boot structure just to deal with ZapUser.

You can use ZapUser to have multiple configurations on one machine. To
change from one to another, just double\-click on the ZapUser you want to
use, and then quit and restart Zap. A range of sample configurations is
available from wherever you obtained Zap - see \k{future}.

\S{zapfonts} \i{ZapFonts}: the global bitmap font resource

ZapFonts is the global bitmap font resource; it is to bitmap fonts what
!Fonts is to outline fonts. Zap uses bitmap fonts in all its file windows,
and several other applications also use it, including \i\e{Messenger} and
\i\e{FreeTerm}. Consequently we want it to be somewhere that they can all
get at it, rather than hidden away inside Zap.

If you have a RISCPC\-style boot structure, then you want to put ZapFonts in
\c{Boot:Resources}. If you don't have a RISCPC\-style boot structure, then
you need to find another place to put ZapFonts so that it will boot before
Zap. If you absolutely can't do this, then you should leave ZapFonts inside
the \c{!Zap} directory, and make sure that Zap boots before anything else
which might need ZapFonts. The best way to do this is to have Zap in the
root directory of your main hard disc; however we strongly suggest that you
use a boot structure of some sort - there are a number of free ones availabe
which should suffice.

Because ZapFonts supplies all the bitmap fonts for all the applications that
want to use it, the complete distribution is fairly large. Consequently the
version in the core Zap distribution is minimal, containing only a couple of
fonts. The complete set is available from wherever you got Zap from (see
\k{future}); it will come as a \c{!ZapFonts} application directory
containing only the additional fonts - you can simply copy it over the top
of your ZapFonts directory. You may need to restart some applications to get
them to recognise the new fonts (this isn't true of Zap, which will
recognise automatically that you have installed new fonts).

For more information on using ZapFonts, please see the documentation
supplied inside its application directory.

\S{support files} Support files

Zap comes with two additional support files you'll want to deal with when you're setting it up.

\c{!Country} is a small utility that you should run at startup which determines the country you've set your computer up for. Ideally you should place it in \c{Boot:Choices.Boot.PreDesk} on a recent boot system, so it will be run before anything else. It sets the environment variable \c{Sys$Country} to whatever your current country is. Zap uses this in its internationalisation support (see \k{internationalisation}).

\c{DDEU_Patch} (apologies for the slightly ugly name!) fixes up \i{Acorn}'s \c{DDEUtils} module (part of their development environment) so that Zap can work with it better. You should simply run it when you install Zap; if your copy of \c{DDEUtils} doesn't need fixing, or if \c{DDEU_Patch} can't fix it, nothing bad will happen.

\H{recommended setup} Recommended extensions setup

The \c{zmods1.zip} archive contains a directory \c{Modules} which should be
copied over !Zap.Modules.

Alternatively, you can install just some of the extensions. If you are
fairly confident, you can do this yourself by simply copying the relevant
applications \e{from} the \c{Modules} directory of the archive \e{into}
\c{!Zap.Modules}. Alternatively, you can install individual extensions using
\i{ZapConfig} - see \k{zapconfig} for more information.

You will then need to quit and restart Zap to complete the setup.

\H{optional setup} Optional extensions setup

Setup for the current optional extensions is the same as for recommended
extensions; see \k{recommended setup}.

RULEHERE

Now you have a working version of Zap. If you currently have an older
version of Zap running, you should quit it; now you should double\-click on
both ZapUser and ZapFonts to make sure that they are setup correctly in
their new locations. Finally you can double\-click on Zap to load it.

The next section in the manual is \k{Basic operation}, which introduces you
to the basic editing facilities of Zap. Even if you have used Zap before we
advise that you at least skim through this section, to make sure you haven't
missed any of the useful functions available.
