\# Some notes about the use of code (\c) versus weak code (\cw).
\#  Filenames, newsgroups and key/mouse button names (shift, select
\#             etc.) are weak code.
\#  Full keystrokes, however, are code. eg: \c{cT} except in lists, when
\#             they are weak code (because it looks better).
\#  Menu options are code.
\#  System variables, c-vars, Zap commands and arguments, are all code.
\#  Code itself is code, obviously.
\#
\# I don't think anything else should be using code. Certainly anything
\# that is in a \W construct shouldn't get \c or \cw on top of that.
\#
\# The important thing is consistency, and it's best to document it here.

\C{Introduction} Introduction

\H{whatiszap} ZAP is a text editor

Welcome to Zap, a text and programmers' editor for Acorn RISC OS. This
manual will help you to learn about its various features, from basic text
editing up to the more sophisticated needs of programming source code and
the like. Don't panic! Just because Zap allows you to do lots and lots of
things doesn't mean that you have to use all the features. If you find that
the default configuration of Zap isn't appropriate for you, but don't want
to get involved in configuring it yourself, there are a range of alternate
configurations available - see \k{other configs}.

\S{manual intro} About this manual

Firstly, in this manual, we have assumed that you are familiar with standard
\i{RISC OS} use and techniques; in particular we assume you understand how
to use the \i\e{Filer} to load applications and files, and the common use of
the mouse and keyboard. Zap behaves like a normal RISC OS application in
many ways - in general, if you think it should work it will do.

Secondly, Zap is highly configurable: all the keypresses can be changed; the
colours Zap uses can be changed; the menus can be changed; and many of the
operations and functions can be customised to work in the way you wish.
However, except for \k{Configuration}, this manual describes Zap in its
default behaviour - the way you get it when you obtain it for the first time
(whether from a CD ROM, Bulletin Board System or via the Internet - see
\k{future}). (This is the reason it is important that you too pass on Zap in
its 'virgin' state - see \cw{!Zap.Resources.UK.Docs.Copyright} for information
about distributing Zap.)

Zap contains both interactive help (using Acorn's \i\e{Help} application),
and its own online help - see \k{help} for more information.

\S{license intro} License

Zap is released as free software; you can use, copy and distribute it free
of charge. In addition, the source code to Zap is available, and you are
encouraged to join in its development if you wish - see \k{Devel} for more
information. The license is supplied with Zap as
\cw{!Zap.Resources.UK.Docs.Copyright}.

\S{contact intro} Getting in touch

If you have any comments about this manual, please get in touch; if you need
specific help with Zap, the best places to try are the Acorn\-related
newsgroups, specifically \i\cw{comp.sys.acorn.apps} - many of the Zap
developers read them thoroughly, and in addition there are other experienced
users who can help you. More information is available in \k{contact}.

\S{recent changes} Recent changes

Major new features and improvements in recent versions of Zap include:

\b Internationalisation - see \k{internationalisation}

\b Mode cloning - see \k{mode cloning}

\b Configuration variables - see \k{c-vars}

\rule

The first section in the manual is \k{Installing}, which shows you how to
install and setup up Zap so that it will work correctly. Even if you already
have a working Zap installation, it is as well to check over this to make
sure you haven't missed anything. This is particularly important if you are
upgrading from an earlier version of Zap, since a number of things have
changed.
