\C{Configuration} Customising and configuring Zap

Now we will look at configuring Zap; as has been mentioned several times before, you can customise many of the features of Zap. Here we'll show you how. Note that some areas of configuration are substantially less complex than others; some, introduced in the first few sections (up to and including \k{per mode config}), are both fairly simple and incredibly useful - you'll almost certainly want to read these at least briefly now. Later ones get increasingly complex - the last few sections of this chapter describe how to completely reconfigure how Zap deals with different filetypes; how to reconfigure all the keystrokes; and how to define Zap's menus! You're unlikely to need these features straight away - so you might want to skip the second part of this chapter until you have a need for these facilities.

Zap uses two distinct types of configuration, known as \e{textual configuration files} and \e{binary configuration files}. You don't really need to know why, but you do need to know what it means. The first options we'll look at are all handled by the binary configuration system, and these are options you can set up from inside Zap. This means that you can change them while it's running, experiment with the settings until you have them right, and then save them so you'll have the same options next time. The second set of options (from \k{settings} onwards) are part of the textual configuration system. To edit these, you'll need to load the relevant configuration file into a text editor, edit them to make the alterations, save them - and then you need to get Zap to reload them.

All configuration options are stored within one place - \i{ZapUser}. As noted in \k{zapuser}, in the installation notes, this means that you can carry your own options around with you, even while using Zap on a different computer.

\H{other configs} Other complete configuration setups

If you don't like the default configuration, but don't want to get your hands dirty trying to set things up yourself - or want to save some time by starting with a configuration closer to what you want - then you might like to look at the alternative configuration sets available from the Zap ftp site. Due to time constraints, these may not be as 'pure' as is ideal - it would be nice to have an \i\e{Emacs}\-like configuration, an \i\e{Edit}\-like configuration, a \i\e{StrongED}\-like configuration, and so on - what you will actually probably find is that the various developers have simply packaged up their own configuration sets, including whatever bizarre (and sometimes fairly specific) needs they have. Nonetheless, they should be useful to someone - in particular, they may well show some of the more sophisticated things that can be done with Zap.

Complete replacement configuration setups come in the form of a copy of \i{ZapUser}; you should follow the instructions in the installation guide to change configuration sets - see \k{zapuser} for more information.

For more information, see \W{http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/download.html}{http://www.zap.uk.eu.org/download.html}, or go straight to the FTP site at \W{ftp://ftp.zap.uk.eu.org/pub/configs/}{ftp://ftp.zap.uk.eu.org/pub/configs/}.

\H{binary config} Binary configuration options

Here we look at the binary configuration options. These can all be edited within Zap, so you can experiment with them until you're happy, then save them so they'll be the same next time.

\S{per mode config} \i{Per\-mode options}

Something we've been mentioning through the manual is that many of the options can be set on a per\-mode basis; that is, that each mode can have these options configured independently of all the other modes. In addition to all the colours, the following options can be configured per\-mode:

\b \e{Display options} - \i{Autowidth}; \i{wrap width}; \i{window wrap}, \i{infinite window wrap}, \i{word wrap}, \i{line wrap}, \i{softwrap}, \i{strong soft wrap} and \i{auto soft wrap}.

\b \e{Edit options} - \i{Line edit}, \i{overwrite}, \i{non\-standard edit}, \i{autoindent}, \i{hex entry}, \i{big endian}, \i{spell-as-you-type}, \i{block edit}, \i{strip spaces on save}, and \i{base keymap}.

\b \i\e{Tabs} - Display, entry (unix, as above, column; insert as spaces).

\b \e{Cursor} - \i{Smart movement}, \i{free click}, \i{confine vertically}, \I{confine horizontally}confine at end of line, \i{line select}.

\b \i\e{Line numbers} - Display (none, logical, physical, address), base (hexadecimal or decimal), margin width and colon display.

There are two main ways of configuring these options. Firstly, and probably
most usefully, you can change the options for a particular window, and then
copy those options across to become the defaults for that mode. You do this
with the \c{Misc->Set default options} menu item. Note that this won't save those
options - merely set them up as the defaults. To save the current default
options, you either need to use \c{Options->Save options} from the iconbar
menu, or \c{Misc->Set default options->Save defaults} from the window menu.

This system can be extended slightly - since each window 'remembers' the options it has for each mode, you can set up the options you like in all the modes using one window, and then set the default options for all modes from this one window in one go. Use \c{Misc->Set default options->All modes} to do this. (Note that this doesn't save the options.)

The only options that won't be copied across in this way are the \i{read only} attributes. This is because it would be rather irritating if every file were opened read only - doubly so if they were opened permanent read only, because then you couldn't make them writable again at all.

The second method is via the iconbar menu. The \c{Options} submenu has a number of submenus and options; the important ones here are \c{Mode}, \c{Edit} and \c{Display} - the mode selected in the \c{Mode} submenu is the mode for which you are configuring options (and the mode\-specific options can be configured through this submenu), and the current settings in \c{Edit} and \c{Display} are its current defaults. You can therefore change the options for any mode by first switching \c{Options->Mode} to the relevant mode, then changing the options in \c{Options->Edit} and \c{Options->Display}.

Once finished, you should always change \c{Options->Mode} back to whatever it was before - this is known as the '\i{default mode}', and is used when Zap doesn't know what mode to drop a file into - and also as the mode when you load a file whilst holding down \cw{Control}. In general, you probably want this to be either Text or Byte. Note that the default mode is actually a textual configuration option - once Zap is loaded you can change it from the iconbar menu, but you can't change the default setting without editing one of the textual configuration files. See \k{settings} for how to do this.

Again, changing options in this way doesn't save them - use \c{Options->Save options} to make these new defaults permanent.

\S{mode cloning} \i{Mode cloning}

Several of Zap's modes are fairly non-specific; they can be used to edit a variety of different types of file. For instance Text, Byte HalfWord, Word and DoubleWord modes assume very little about the content of the file - unlike Code, Email or HoTMeaL (the HTML mode), for instance. Consequently you may want to use them in different situations with different default settings.

The way to do this is to create a \e{clone} of the mode. This is an exact copy of a mode, given a different name, and which you can configure differently. A cloned mode is used exactly as you would a normal mode.

Clones are managed via \c{Options->Clone modes...} from the iconbar menu. This opens a small dialogue box which lists the current clones you have (as Zap is supplied, there are no clone modes). The top half of the window allows you to select the different clones you have, to see which mode they are based on, and to \c{Delete} and \c{Hide} the one currently being shown. Deleting a clone will also delete its options; only do this if you won't need them again! Hiding a clone removes it from currently loaded modes; since Zap can only cope with thirty two modes loaded at one time, this allows you to work with many more clones.

To create a new clone, click on \c{New} in the dialogue box. This creates another small dialogue allowing you to enter the new clone's name, and to select which mode you would like the clone to act like. Currently, in addition to the core modes Text, Byte, HalfWord, Word, DoubleWord, ASCII and Code, only Email mode can be cloned - and clones themselves can be cloned. Clicking on \c{Create} will create the clone, set up initially with the options of the base mode you selected.

Cloned modes show up in blue instead of black in the mode menu. Non-core modes (such as Email) show up in grey.

Clone don't appear on \c{Mode->Load mode} in the main window, or \c{Options->Mode->Load mode} in the iconbar menu; instead, they have their own \c{Load clone} submenu.

As with all binary options, you must remember to save Zap's options (\c{Options->Save options} from the iconbar menu) once you have made alterations to your clones - otherwise you will lose them when you quit Zap.

\S{cursor config} Configuring Zap's cursors

You may remember that Zap has four different cursors - the usual editing cursor, two cursors used when you are in copy mode, and a 'mark' cursor to indicate where the cursor would be in a window that doesn't have the focus. (See \k{cursors} for more information.) You can configure how these are drawn from \c{Options->Cursor types}; each can be set to any one of \c{block}, \c{square}, \c{underscore}, \c{bar} or \c{none}; they all should be fairly self\-explanatory.

\S{minibuffer config} Configuring the \i{minibuffer}

You can configure how the minibuffer works from \c{Options\->Mini buffer}; you can set the foreground and background colour, whether the system font (the alternative being the desktop font) is used under RISC OS 3.5 or later (or the soft\-loadable 'nested wimp'), and whether the minibuffer is permanently available, or just pops up when needed.

\S{misc config} Miscellaneous configuration options

Zap has a variety of miscellaneous options which you can set on or off. They are configured through \c{Options->Misc}, and are as follows:

\b \c{Auto-delete files} - Auto\-delete files when the last window is closed; if not, files will hang around until you remove them directly using \c{Files->Remove} or \c{Files->Close} on the iconbar menu.

\b \c{Auto-clear regions} - Automatically clear the selection when you do anything which doesn't use the selection (this is like various word processing and DTP packages).

\b \c{Undo supported} - Whether \i{undo} is supported for all newly\-created or \-loaded files.

\b \c{Flashing cursor} - Whether Zap's editing cursors flash - you can also configure the flash rate (see \k{settings}).

\b \c{Check datestamp} - Warn if you try to save to a file where the copy on disc is newer than the file you're trying to save (this can cause problems if saving over a network where the clocks on the different computers aren't properly in sync).

\b \c{Auto-clr search} - Clear the search window each time it is opened.

\b \c{Confine cursor} - Confine the cursor so that when you scroll a window it remains in sight.

\b \c{Trap MSDOS files} - Recognise files with \I{DOS files}MSDOS and \I{Spool files}Spool file line endings, and take appropriate action.

\b \c{Be tolerant} - Be tolerant of other applications which use broken Wimp messages; some applications, including \i\e{Fresco}, may not function properly with Zap unless this is turned on.

\b \c{Silent operation} - Don't beep.

\b \c{No anti-aliasing} - Don't use anti\-aliasing when using DSA outline font redraw; sometimes it can look messy, so turning it off makes things easier to read.

\b \c{Remove H scroll} - Avoid having a horizontal scrollbar when it isn't needed - it will be turned off when window wrap mode is turned on, and also when the window is at its fullest extent. The latter will only happen under the 'nested wimp'.

\b \c{Force startup command} - Forces the startup command to be executed even if files are being loaded on startup. See \k{settings} for more information.

\b \c{Minibuffer autowidth} - Sets the width of the minibuffer to match the width of the window it's being used with. Otherwise it will use the width set for it in the Templates file (which isn't terribly useful).

\S{autoload} Autoloading internal extensions

Zap has a number of 'internal' extensions, introduced in \k{internal}, which it can load automatically when it thinks it needs them. None of these is essential, but they can make life easier in some cases. Whether they are automatically loaded or not is configured from \c{Options->Misc->Autoload} (Zap will use them if they weren't set to be autoloaded, but were loaded for some other reason - for instance by the user, or by another application).

\H{textual config} Textual configuration

Here we look at the different options that are part of the textual configuration system. This is all accessed through the bottom part of the \c{Options} submenu from the iconbar. Firstly, you can open any textual configuration file using the \c{Options->Edit config} submenu - and you can open the directory containing all of them by selecting \c{Options->Edit config} itself.

Secondly, you reload the settings using \c{Options->Reload keys}. This will work for everything except the filetypes configuration, where you have to rebuild all the options first (this is because, in addition to the user\-specified filetype configuration, each mode can tell Zap which types of file it knows about) - do this through \c{Options->Create keys}, and then use \c{Options->Reload keys} to get the new options.

Except for the \c{Menus} file, all the textual configuration files use the same format. Any non\-blank line defines a single \e{key variable}, and is of the following form.

\c <comment> &xxx <value>

The comment is any text without an ampersand (\c{&}) character in it. Any line without an ampersand in it is discarded completely. The &xxx is known as the \e{key number}, and dictates what the value is actually used for. For instance, it might be a particular setting, or it might be a key binding.

\S{settings} Miscellaneous settings

The Settings file is divided into two sections: firstly Zap's search macros. These have key numbers &200 to &20F; the value is of the form \c{macro_string replacement_string}, with the strings separated by whitespace. The macro string can be up to seven characters, and the replacement string up to 23 characters.

The second part of the Settings file is various miscellaneous options. They are as follows:

\b &300 - Date format to use for the \c{INSERTDATE} (\c{scD}) command; see \c{OS_ConvertDateAndTime} for details of the format string.

\b &301 - Time format to use for the \c{INSERTTIME} (\c{scT}) command.

\b &302 - Default anti\-aliased font name.

\b &303 - Number of blank lines to leave at the end of a window.

\b &304 - Default anti\-aliased font size in points.

\b &305 - Number of pixels to shave off the top of an anti\-aliased font character.

\b &306 - Number of pixels to shave off the bottom of an anti\-aliased font character.

\b &307 - Codes to send to the printer at the end of a line for '\i{quick print}'. This string is \cw{GSTrans}ed first.

\b &308 - Number of characters to keep the cursor from the left margin.

\b &309 - Number of characters to keep the cursor from the right margin.

\b &30A - Number of characters to keep the cursor from the top margin.

\b &30B - Number of characters to keep the cursor from the bottom margin.

\b &30C - Window left margin, in OS units.

\b &30D - Window left margin, in OS units.

\b &30E - Command to run when Select clicked on iconbar icon.

\b &30F - Command to run when Adjust clicked on iconbar icon.

\b &310 - Number of pixels to shave off the left of an anti\-aliased font character.

\b &311 - Number of pixels to shave off the right of an anti\-aliased font character.

\b &312, &313 - Reserved.

\b &314 - Minibuffer size in characters.

\b &315 - Default indent string.

\b &316 - Flashing cursor on period in centiseconds.

\b &317 - Flashing cursor off period in centiseconds.

\b &318 - Minimum auto\-width width.

\b &319 - Maximum auto\-width width.

\b &31A - Name of the bitmap font to use in low resolution modes.

\b &31B - Name of the bitmap font to use in high resolution modes.

\b &31C - Default attributes to use for newly created files.

\b &31D - Dialogue box offsets from parent window, in OS units (as: \cw{x,y}).

\b &31E - Reserved.

\b &31F - Codes to send to the printer at the start of the file for '\i{quick print}'. This string is \cw{GSTrans}ed first.

\b &320 - Codes to send to the printer at the end of the file for '\i{quick print}'. This string is \cw{GSTrans}ed first.

\b &321 - Minimum time between backups, in seconds.

\b &322 - Command executed on startup. This will only be executed if no files are being loaded on startup, unless the \c{Force startup command} option is enabled. This variable may be useful for \i{NCOS} users.

\b &323 - Default mode.

\S{filetypes} Zap's behaviour with different file types and locations

There are two filetype configuration files: \c{Types (low)} and \c{Types (high)}. Typically you should put user configuration things in \c{Types (low)}. \c{Types (high)} is intended for resolving conflicts between different modes, which might both try to grab a particular file - \c{Types (high)} would allow you to ensure that the fight is always won by the mode that you choose.

These files contain two types of variable. Firstly, &1xxx variables (which also includes &2000), which affect which mode files of a particular type are loaded into, and secondly &5xx variables, which affect which mode files with certain filenames are loaded into. Both have a similar final part, which is the \e{command}. This is of the form \c{[+]<mode name>[:<command(s)>]}.

The mode name indicates which mode a file will be loaded into if it matches
this rule; the optional \c{+}, if present, will cause the file to be loaded
even if Shift is not held down. The command(s) after the mode name, if
present, will be executed after the file is loaded. For instance, the
default configuration has the following command for all files of type &100:
\c{Byte : STARTADDR 55}; files of this type are loaded into Byte mode, and
then the command \c{STARTADDR 55} is executed. There is no '+', so you have
to either drag the file to Zap's iconbar, or double click it while holding
down \cw{Shift} (left \cw{Shift} on \i{RISC OS 2}).

Now we'll look at the two different sorts of rules. The first is a very simple rule: is the file of a certain filetype? We use the &1xxx variables for this - they have the form \c{<comment> &1xxx <command>}, where command is as above, and comment is as usual. The xxx specifies which filetype this rule matches, in hexadecimal. Use the key variable &2000 to match untyped files.

The second possible rule is more complex. These are the &5xx variables, and they work by trying to match the complete filename against a Zap \i{search} string. The format is \c{<comment> &5xx <filetype> <path> <command>}. Comment and command are as above; path is a normal Zap search expression (see \k{Searching} - note that \i{macros} won't work, but \i{\\-commands} will). The xx here is completely irrelevant - typically you would have all your &5xx variables actually using &500 as the key number. The command is executed only if both filetype and path match; a filetype of \-1 can be used to match all filetypes.

As an example, consider the following from the default configuration:

\c      &500    &FFD    \\ #\\*.o.\\o\\*     +Code

This will load any file of type &FFD (Data), that is within a directory called \c{o}, into Code mode. (ie: it ensures that object files, as produced by C compilers and similar, will be loaded into Code mode). The \c{+} ensures that it will be loaded without needing to drag to Zap's iconbar, or to hold down Shift.

Remember that you must run \c{Options->Recreate keys} before reloading to get changes to the filetypes configuration to work properly.

\S{keyboard config} Configuring Zap's keystrokes

The \cw{Keys} file defines Zap's base \i{keymaps}: in addition, extensions can have their own \cw{Keys} files in the extension directory so that keymaps that are useful only to individual extensions don't need to be supplied with the main Zap distribution.

Each keymap is introduced by an &800 key variable, with the exception of the first keymap in the \cw{Keys} file, which is the default. (Note that this only applies to Zap's core \cw{Keys} file - per-extension files cannot contain default keymaps, and must have all their keymaps introduced by an &800 variable.) The value of an &800 variable is actually four values; it looks as follows.

\c <comment> &800 <low> <high> <name> <base>

<low> and <high> define the range of the keymap, in keycodes - for keypresses outside that range, the keymap will do nothing. <name> is the name of the new keymap; this name is used on the \c{Misc->Keymap} menu, and by the \c{KEYMAPN} and \c{BASEMAPN} commands. <base> is the name of the base for this keymap - any keycodes that are not defined in the keymap, but which fall within the range of the keymap, are inherited from this base keymap. 

The key variables &000-&1FF define the keymap itself; the value is the command or commands (\c{:}\-separated, as usual) to be executed on that keycode - we'll go into this in more detail in a minute.

The keymap used as the base map for any mode which doesn't choose its own is given by key variable &400. Base maps for modes can be set using the configuration variable \c{Basemap} - see \k{c-vars} for more information about configuration variables.

Keycodes are based on those returned by \c{Wimp_Poll}; thus function keys return &180-&1FF, as documented in the PRMs. (Look at the \cw{Keys} file if you don't have a copy of the PRMs - or get the WimpKeys manual for \i\e{StrongHelp}. Standard characters return their ASCII values &20-&FF as usual. &7F is unshifted \cw{Delete}. Additionally, Zap augments these basic values to allow, for instance, to have \c{scD} and \c{cD} doing different things. These are documented in \cw{Docs.Technical.E-Keycodes}.

To make life easier, you can define a range of keycodes in one line, simply by specifying the range instead of a single keycode. For instance, to map \cw{F1}-\cw{F8} to insert \c{Please don't press this key again}, use something like:

\c F1-F8 &181-188 INSERT "Please don't press this key again"

There are a number of special substitutions which happen for keycode definitions, both in the base keymap and in subsequent ones. Firstly, if you use \c{n} instead of the numeric parameter to a command, it will be replaced by the keycode. For instance:

\c Ascii chars &020-7E CHAR n

in the default keymap makes sure that typing a character will insert that character.

Secondly, instead of a command you can use \c{*<n>}. Here, the command will be taken from the keycode n. If you omit the \c{n} (ie: just use \c{*}), then the keycode used will be the keycode you are currently defining, in the base keymap (for instance, in the \i\e{Emacs} keymap, we have:

\c &01E-14E *

which defines most of the Emacs keymap to be the same as the Default keymap that it inherits from. If you use this substitution in a keycode range, it will work in the most sensible way: for instance, in the base keymap the keypad numbers are mapped to do the same as the number keys using:

\c k0-k9 &1C0-1C9 *&30

If you want to stop a keystroke from being passed on, bind \c{NULL} to it. Try to avoid binding anything to \cw{F12}, because it will stop you easily accessing the command prompt.

\S{clicksend config} Configuring Click Send

It is possible to configure the \cw{Alt}+double click behaviour of Zap from the ClickSend file. This uses key variables &6xx (as with the &5xx variables, the xx doesn't matter and you should usually use &600 for all of them). The format is documented at the header of the file, and is fairly difficult to explain in any other way. In general you won't need to alter this, but if you do it's probably advisable to talk to \W{mailto:ds@zap.uk.eu.org}{Darren Salt}, author of the Click Send system, if you start running into problems. See \k{contact} for details of how to get in touch with Darren.

\S{menus} Configuring Zap's menus

Zap's \cw{Menus} file defines all the menus that Zap uses. The format is fairly simple: any line starting with '|' is treated as a comment and is discarded; blank lines are also discarded. The file then starts with a single initial line which specifies the number of valid menu handles (so you need to set this to at least as many menus as you define, or some of them won't load). After this are a series of menu definitions.

Each menu definition contains a declaring line of the form:

\c <handle>     <name>

The name must be given in quotes. In Zap's actual \cw{Menus} file, handles are numbers that start at zero, with the first twenty (0-19) reserved for internal use (see below). However it is more convenient to work from a 'source' format, where the handles are names instead of numbers - symbolic handles start with a dot (\c{.}). Zap is supplied with a program called \cw{MakeMenus} which generates the actual \cw{Menus} file from the source file; it lives in \cw{ZapCode:Tools.MakeMenus}, which also contains more detailed documentation. Source menus files live in \cw{ZapUser:Config.Menus.Source}.

In addition to allowing handles to be names instead of numbers, \cw{MakeMenus} provides a preprocessor vaguely similar to that used by C compilers. This allows a source file to provide various options which can be turned either on or off when generating the real file. Zap is supplied with a program that gives a simple text interface to configuring these options, called \cw{MenuConf} (which also lives in \cw{ZapCode:Tools.MakeMenus}.

In order to work, \cw{MenuConf} requires a block somewhere in the file describing the options supported by that file. The block is of the form:

\c | Start options
\c |  [*]<option name>   <description>
\c ...
\c | End options

A star (\c{*}) at the start of an option name indicates that the option is turned on in the default configuration. The delimiter lines (\c{| Start options} and \c{| End options} must be preserved exactly. See \cw{ZapUser:Config.Menus.Source.UK} for an example with plenty of options.

The \c{Options->Edit config->Menus} submenu from the iconbar contains three options which use this: \c{Menus source} opens the source file for the current country, \c{Run MenuConf} allows you to select which of its options are enabled and disabled, and generates the real file, and \c{Rebuild defaults} rebuilds the default menus for the current country.

The following menu handles are reserved for internal use, and are listed here with the symbolic names that \cw{MakeMenus} supports.

\b 0 - Iconbar menu. Symbolic name: \cw{Zap.Iconbar}

\b 1 - Window menu. Symbolic name: \cw{Zap.Window}

\b 2 - Filetype menu. Symbolic name: \cw{Zap.Filetypes}

\b 3 - Reserved.

\b 4 - Main font menu. Symbolic name: \cw{Zap.Fonts}

\b 5 - Selection menu. Symbolic name: \cw{Zap.Selection}

\b 6-9 - Reserved.

\b 10 - Throwback mode menu. Symbolic name: \cw{Mode.Throwback}

\b 11 - Byte mode menu. Symbolic name: \cw{Mode.Byte}

\b 12 - Word mode menu. Symbolic name: \cw{Mode.Word}

\b 13 - Reserved.

\b 14 - Code mode menu. Symbolic name: \cw{Mode.Code}

\b 15 - HalfWord mode menu. Symbolic name: \cw{Mode.Halfword}

\b 16 - DoubleWord mode menu. Symbolic name: \cw{Mode.Doubleword}

\b 17-19 - Reserved.

After the declaration for a menu is a series of lines giving the items in it. Each of these must be indented by a single tab character (ASCII 9).

\c      Text    [<command>]     [> (<command> | <menu handle>)]

The text must be quoted; the first command is executed if the menu item is selected by the user. Anything after a \c{>} character defines a submenu - either give a command which can supply a submenu (any command that takes a string parameter can be used as a submenu; in addition, some commands specifically create submenus), or give a valid menu handle to use as the submenu.

If you need to, you can specify Wimp help text for each menu and menu item. This is done using a line of the form:

\c      *       Text

The line should come immediately after the entry it describes. To supply default help for a menu, place the help line first in the menu definition (before any menu entries). The text must be quoted.

If you want to use a command which isn't part of the core, you can do so; it won't be loaded until it's actually needed. This allows you to have very flexible menus, without a huge memory overhead of loading all the extensions when Zap starts up.

To get a separator line in a menu, use a line containing a tab character (ASCII 9) followed by a hyphen \c{-}.

See the supplied \cw{Menus} file, and the supplied source files, for examples on how this all fits together; it's actually a lot easier to use than to describe!

Note that it is impossible to get Zap to reload its menus. In order to get edited menus in Zap, you'll have to quit and restart it.

\S{c-vars} c-vars

Configuration variables (or c-vars for short) are Zap's way of allowing the same command or feature to function in different ways depending on the mode you're in. Each mode within Zap can have a \e{Textual Mode File}, or \i\e{TMF} for short, which defines the c-vars for that mode.

For a mode <name>, its \i{TMF} is looked for first as \cw{ZapUser:Config.TMFs.<name>}, and then in the file given the system variable \c{Zap$TMF_<name>}. Core modes and clones will typically just have their TMFs in \cw{ZapUser:Config.TMFs}; other modes will usually have their default TMFs within their application directory: you should copy them into \cw{ZapUser:Config.TMFs} and edit there to override their options.

The format of a \i{TMF} is as a \i\e{MessageTrans} file (the same format as used for Zap's internationalised messages files - see \k{internationalisation} for internationalisation issues). This means that lines starting with a \c{#} character are treated as comments (ignored), and that all other lines must be of the form:

\c <variable>:<value>

The value is subjected to \e{interpolation} to find the final value; this allows the values of other c-vars to be used within the definition of any given c-var (although care must be taken to ensure that you don't indirectly include the value you are trying to define, or Zap may enter an infinite loop while trying to figure out what to do!).

The syntax for interpolation is \c{/<modename>:<variablename>/}, where both \c{<modename>} and \c{<variablename>} are optional - although at least one must be present (otherwise you're trying to include yourself!). If either is missing, it will be filled in with the appropriate value for the variable being defined - so \c{/:<variablename>/} will expand to the value of \c{<variablename>} in the current mode, and \c{/<modename>:/} (or \c{/<modename>/}) will expand to the value of the current variable in mode \c{<modename>}.

In addition, \c{<modename>} can be either one of the special characters \c{^} (meaning the parent of the current mode) or \c{@} (meaning the current mode).

This means that the \c{/} (slash) character can't be inserted directly into
the value of a c-var. To get around this, the \c{\\} (backslash) character
'escapes' the following character - so \c{ab\\cd} is equivalent to \c{abcd},
and \c{ab\\/d} will come out as \c{ab/d}.

A few examples should explain things:

\c HelpSearchPath:MySearch,/C++/

Sets the value of the c-var \c{HelpSearchPath} to \c{MySearch,<foo>} where \c{foo} is the value of \c{HelpSearchPath} in C++ mode.

\c SetNameStart:\\<\/* >

Sets the value of the c-var \c{SetNameStart} to \c{\\</* >}.

Any c-vars not listed for a given mode will be \e{inherited} from the mode's parent. For instance, if the variable \c{TestVariable} is defined in Text mode, but not in C mode, using it within C mode will actually use the value given for Text mode - because C mode is derived from Text mode. What this means is that if you want to set a c-var once for all modes, you should put it in the \i{TMF} for Text mode (since all modes are derived from Text mode).

Note that c-vars for cloned modes inherit from the clone's base, and \e{not} from the clone's base's parent. So if, in the example above, we clone C mode as D, and then give \c{TestVariable} a value for C mode that is different to its value for Text mode, when we use \c{TestVariable} in D mode, the value from C mode will be used (which is more or less what you'd expect). C mode will still inherit variables from its parent, in this case Text.

c-vars are case-sensitive. When developing your own features using c-vars, please remember that mixed-case c-vars (eg: \c{HelpSearchPath}, \c{SetNameStart}) are reserved for 'official' use - ie for features that have been finished. While developing new features, either prepend \c{_} (underscore) to your c-var name, or use all upper or all lower-case.

In order to get help on a c-var, use the \i\c{HELPVAR} command, or type \c{c\\ v} and type in the c-var name.

In the future, c-vars will be able to be set on a per-file basis. Currently this isn't possible.

\H{internationalisation} Internationalisation

As it is supplied, all Zap's communication with you will be in English. However there is support for complete and relatively painless translation to other languages. In order, Zap will use the system variable \c{Zap$Country}, the system variable \c{Sys$Country} or "UK" to determine which country it needs to run for.

To make life easier, Zap has a single file, \cw{ZapUser:Config.Country}, where you can set the country to use. By default, the line to set this is commented out, so Zap will use your system setting - only change this if you want to force Zap to use a different country.

If a particular part of Zap isn't available in the country you choose, Zap will use the English (UK) version instead. Currently much of Zap's core distribution is supplied for France and Germany as well as the UK (see \k{credits}).

\H{riscos version} Differences in different versions of \i{RISC OS}

Due to different features supplied by different versions of RISC OS itself, Zap has a few issues which alter depending on which operating system you are using. Note that as of v1.45, Zap no longer supports RISC OS 2.

\S{dynamic areas} Dynamic areas

Zap uses dynamic area storage for files and fonts from RISC OS 3.5; it uses the Wimp Slot in earlier versions of the operating system. (Note that there is a utility called \i\e{Dummy Dynamic Areas}, which supplies dynamic area support for earlier operating systems; Zap will use this if it is present.)

\S{templates} Templates

Note that there is a bug in the ROM fonts supplied with some versions of RISC OS 3.7 (notably for the A7000+), which means that the OldStyle template set doesn't work properly (it can spontaneously reset the desktop font to the system font). This problem does not affect the Default template set.

\S{ncos} \i{NCOS}

In theory, Zap should work on NCOS (Network Computer Operating System - as used in Acorn's NetStation, and other similar products). There are two issues: firstly, the iconbar under NCOS is hidden until someone puts an icon on it; Zap supports a \c{-noicon} option to prevent it from doing this, and a command \c{INSTALLICON} to place an icon on the iconbar if it hasn't already done so. However \c{-noicon} isn't used as standard under NCOS; you'll have to edit \cw{!Zap.!Run} (\cw{!Zap.!Run,feb}) to get this behaviour. Secondly, since NCOS has no Filer, loading files is more tricky - particularly so if you don't have an iconbar icon either. The settings variables &322, which allows you to specify a command to run at startup, can be set to \c{NEWFILE (Text &FFF)} to open a blank text file automatically in this case. You can then use \c{FINDFILE} (\cw{F2}) to load files.

The authors are uncertain about the utility of Zap under NCOS in any case; however if you have any difficulties with Zap on NCOS (or any information about its being useful :\-), please get in touch (see \k{contact}).

The next section in the manual is \k{Extensions}, which introduces a number of useful extensions to Zap. In particular, it looks at \i\e{ZapSpell} (an interface to the \i{Computer Concepts}' spell checker), and introduces Olly Betts' invaluable \i{line editor}.

Alternatively, you could move on to \k{Devel}, which you should read if you want to help with Zap development, whether in a technical or non\-technical role.
