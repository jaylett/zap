Zap - combined bug and wishlist
===============================

You probably want to turn on auto-width for this file, because otherwise it
looks messy. This list is two things:

1.	A list of *all* suggestions that I know about, possibly with notes.
Some suggestions may be altered - for instance, a suggestion on how to get
ZapRedraw to auto-unload itself was modified to use a more sensible way of
doing it. Discussions to <zap-features@zap.uk.eu.org>.

2.	A list of all bugs I know about. This is different to 'all bug
reports I know about', because if a bug report both contains insufficient
information to get an idea what went wrong AND is unrepeatable, there's
nothing we can do with it anyway. Discussions to <zap-buglist@zap.tartarus.org>.

!  Things required before next stable version
!   * license: BSD?
!   * Remember to make everything non-test before we release v1.45 ...
!
!    Crash bugs
!* (* HoTMeaL)	()		(vincent)	Crash on opening a menu (can't reproduce - check bug report) -- check running as France with Vincent's bindings etc.
!* (* TMT's)	()		(vincent)	abort on dc when loading a file (can't reproduce - check bug report) -- check running as France with Vincent's bindings etc.
!* (* LaTeX)	()		(theo)		Shift-double click or iconbar drop load a &ACA wu1/tex latex file causes data abort or hang; quitting by alt+break and repeating works fine (can't reproduce - check bug report)
!    Memory crash bugs
!* ()		()		(andre)		Cutting 0x400000 of 5MB file causes a crash; cutting first 0x100000 four times does not. (Text + byte modes.)
!* ()		()		(james)		Inserting data (CHAR or PASTE at least) can trash Zap when it runs out of memory. Overwrites heap descriptor? May be related to Chris' bug.
!* ()		()		(chris)		With a small amount of memory free (200K or so), files much larger than remaining memory cause the expected no memory error; files only slightly larger cause a data abort
!* ()		()		(james)		Occasionally, cutting and pasting really quickly freezes the machine?
!
!    Other bugs
!* (* BASIC)	()		(andrew hill)	Large BASIC files get corrupted when saved / cause corruption in copy/paste buffers
!* (Printing)	()		()		Interaction with some printer drivers causes garbage at limits of file?
!* (* Diff)	()		(justin)	Line numbers disrupt colouring for a few characters near the start of the line
!* (Commands)	()		(justin)	@GREYED "TASKWINDOW_CONTROL 0" doesn't work - always returns the same thing
!
!    Low-priority bugs
!* (* Email)	()		(tony v der h)	List of functions (from menu) causes subsequent data abort on saving (can't replicate)
!* (Redraw)	()		(jerome)	Mode 13 squishes windows horizontally and they don't refresh? (can't replicate)
!* ()		()		(paul johnson)	Debug-compiled programs under task window aborts on prefetch when it exits. (RO4 only ...) Justin: ignore for now
!
!    Feature requests / minor misfeatures
!+ (* HoTMeaL)	()		()		&degree; isn't valid but &deg; is - we recognise the wrong one
!+ (* Diff)	()		(justin)	Can't cope with CVS diffs
!
!    Distribution / documentation issues (immediately before release)
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Menus should be built from source at distribution time. So should the ConfigScan, CreateConf, MakeMenus and MenuConf binaries, if possible. MakeMenus is required to do the first part of this, of course.
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Some France (at least) core menus have overly long menu titles. Some menus have't been translated, either?
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Copyright etc. (including stuff in manual). License for core (BSD?).
!* (%)		(james)		(jerome)	Updated ZapBASIC HelpData for France
!* (%)		()		(james)		France trans: HelpData (infobox help, MISCOPS, new-style conversion)
!* (%)		()		(james)		France trans: Messages (zap_m_zmode, zap_d_modflags, zap_q_insrep, zap_q_delrep, zap_d_modflags)
!* (* MJE)	()		(james)		France trans: HelpData (_COMMENTSET, _INDENTCOMMENTSET, _IF, _SHOWPREPROSET, _SMARTINDENTING)
!* (* Spell)	()		(james)		France trans: HelpData (SPELL_CLOSE)
!* (* Email)	()		(james)		France trans: HelpData (_RETURNRECEIPTTO, _DELHEADERLINE, @_HASSIGNATURE, @_{,MORE}FLAGSTOGGLE, @_HASHEADERLINE)
!* (* JRF)	()		(james)		HelpData for JRF_MENUFORMODE
!
|    Web/ftp site issues
!* (#)		(james)		(james)		Better explanation of stable/alpha/beta
!* (#)		(james)		(james)		Get the latest versions of developers' ZapUsers up onto the ftp site
!* (#)		(james)		(james)		Remaining website docs updates. Change lists.

!  Things where effectively nothing has to happen right now
!    Missing sources
!* (!)		()		(james)		ZapMan source (David O'Shea, the author, has it - he'll probably do the updating)
!* (!)		()		(james)		ZapBasAsm source (Carl has it - he may do the updating)
!* (!)		()		(james)		ZapSAsm source

!  Things done to prepare for v1.44 candidate releases
!* (%)		(christian)	(james)		Make sure all !ReadMe files etc. are up to date - esp. !ZapFonts, !ZapUser
!* (* HoTMeaL)	(james)		(andy wingate)	HoTMeaL crashes if you delete a first line <HEAD> with a second line <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"> -- data abort in the backwards-searching comment redraw (?) routing? (offset 0x50d4) -- fix is nasty, preventing crash at cost of worse comment colouring
!* (!)		(christian)	(james)		Check E-Library is up to date immediately before release -- E-Library now built automatically
!* (%)		(james)		(darren)	ZapEmail v0.26 test 3
!* (!)		(james)		(f bambrough)	There's a new version of IClear
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		!Install file for zap.zip et al (needs to be done automatically from manual?)
!* (%)		(christian)	(r hallas)	'Disc' not 'disk' throughout
!* (%)		(d thielsch)	(james)		Germany trans: HelpData (infobox help, MISCOPS, new-style conversion)
!* (* Diff)	(james)		(christian)	(Potentially) wrong mode number used in call to Zap_BaseMode: should get it from [R13] not w_format?
!* () 		(ds/christian)	()		Reload keys causes minibuffer to stop displaying anything /sometimes/ ... possibly fixed with Darren's fixing of MULTICOMMAND on menus?
!* (* Makefile)	(christian)	(s bellon)	Data Aborts in redraw with split at end of file - most of Tim's modes were susceptible
!* (* ZapEmail)	(darren)	(ben laughton)	Ignore sig separator causes "Add sig" button to Prefetch
!* (Commands)	(darren)	(christian)	MULTICOMMANDS don't work on menus
!* (* ZapMJE)	(james)		(tony v der h)	_IF, _ENDIF don't work in Pascal, C++ - probably because the ? operator doesn't do what the code expects in s.Tables?
!* (TMT modes)	(james)		(james)		Check that all modes that load Scripts files and use LFto00 do so safely. And that I haven't screwed the mode while converting, sigh. :-(
!* (%)		(christian)	(james)		Make sure nothing points to Dominic, Tim or Martin for contact ...
!* (Throwback)	(christian)	(james)		Right-clicking (to remove) a filename in throwback doesn't remove all links, and hence doesn't remove the entire file
!* (Commands)	(christian)	(james)		NEWTYPE from minibuffer doesn't close the minibuffer.
!* (TaskW) 	(christian)	(justin)	Clearing the window (eg: change line length) doesn't reset all variables? Up (with LineEditor) causes scrolling to the /old/ cursor position?
!* (EE)		(christian)	(john tytgat)	Saving tries to use f_name instead of <Wimp$Scrap>. Is this perhaps due to f_proposedname?
!* (Commands)	(darren)	(simon b)	NEWVIEW from the text window's menu sometimes (regularly?) gets the offset wrong. May fix some similar bugs?
!* (ModeBits)	(christian)	(justin)	Loading the max # modes puts Zap causes the Modes menu to data abort when being created @ offset 0x20568 in Zap
!* (* Diff)	(darren)	(david ruck)	Can't detect the diff type from lines of the form "4,5c6,7"
!* (Menus)	(christian)	(james)		Interactive help for entries within Misc->Keymap are garbage
!* (Printing)	(christian)	(guy griffin)	Fancy print prints just outside the top and bottom borders
!* (Commands)	(darren)	(james)		Help on functions, c-vars doesn't work any more.
!* (Boxes)	(christian)	()		Fancy print says 'No driver' if there isn't one loaded, rather than nothing at all
!* (* HotMeaL)	(james)		(various)	Interaction with ZapButtons causes crashes - file loading code didn't provide aligned 0 word that LFto00 code was expecting. This may affect other Buttons providers.
!* (* HoTMeaL)	(james)		(lenny)		Cycle window button doesn't respect adjust, so the TBS chars window can't be accessed
!* ()		(james)		(simon b)	DeepKeys as <Boot$ToBeLoaded>.!!DeepKeys. Zap shouldn't load it, just behave sensibly if it isn't there.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Finish zipdiff
!* (Help)	(darren)	(andy wingate)	!Help was showing newlines as 'M'
!* (* Messages)	(chris)		(steve revill)	'|' followed by a tab displays very strangely ...
!* (* ZapEmail)	(james)		(darren)	New version of ZapEmail
!* (!)		(james)		(jeremy poulter)'Use colour' icon should be type click. Check that documentation for the box is up to date also.
!* (!)		(james)		(christian)	R-Example2 (two windows)
!* (!)		(james)		(chris lund)	Loading ZapRedraw should fail if it isn't v0.39, since Zap will now toast with v0.38 ...
!* (* BASIC)	(james)		(steve revill)	Colours LDM and STM in text foreground colour, not their own (oops - wasn't building true under Unix :-(
!* (* MJE)	(james)		(tony v der h)	C++ mode menu on ibar can cause crash (RO4); Java menu always does (RO 3.6 onwards)
!* (* Scheme)	(james)		(christian)	No config block => 'bad colour num' error, no mode menu, etc.
!* (* ZapHTML)	(james)		(david ruck)	Copyright date is 1900 not 2000 ...
!+ (* ZapTeX)	(james)		(stefan)	more button bar stuff
!* (* ZapText)	(james)		(david ruck)	FILTER* commands have been broken: 'Overflow in argument substitution'
!* (* ZapSpell)	(james)		(darren)	test4 uses 0.19 when 0.20 is available :-(
!* (ZapFonts)	(james)		(ros share)	!ZapFonts.!{Boot,Run} use "os$var" not "<os$var>" -- abbreviated form is only valid on RO4
!* (* ZapMJE)	(james)		(james)		menus should use CLONEBASE to grey them out
!* (ZapFonts)	(james)		(christian)	All data files should be explicitly typed NFS-style so that RO unzip unpacks them correctly and so doesn't confuse Messenger
!* (KeyBits)	(darren)	(dan ellis)	Auto-repeating keys sometimes lose their modifiers in buffering. May be a RISC OS problem, maybe not. (Should have been fixed in move to DeepKeys.)
!* (* Email)	(darren)	(james)		Either basemap shouldn't be set, or the new basemap should be closer to the default
!* (! ZapFonts)	(james)		(c ludlam)	R-Example references E-Library in the wrong place (perhaps shouldn't at all?)
!* (!)		(james)		(various)	Default template set save modified dbox shouldn't have the expanding icon
!* (ZapRedraw)	(darren)	(david ruck)	ViewFinder and recent ZapRedraws crashes
!* ()		(darren)	()		Alt-Esc exits block editing
!* (+ Code)	(darren)	(stewart)	Add 'module flags' header word display
!* (*)		(james)		(darren)	New versions of ZapBits, ZapText, ZapUtil, ZapBASIC which use history buffers
!* (!)		(james)		(darren)	Check we have latest Debugger, ExtBASICasm
!* (Commands)	(darren)	(r darlington)	MOVESEL called from menu moves to beginning or end not caret, and latter causes undo buffer corruption
!* ()		(james)		(james)		ZapFonts images are wrong for RISC OS 4.
!* (* MJE)	(james)		(alex m)	MJE_REINDENT in non-MJE modes crashes (data abort) ... can't reproduce on my build, but it /is/ reindenting non-MJE modes, which it definitely shouldn't do ...
!* (!)		(james)		(reuben)	Menus should say 'GNU Filters', not 'Process "GNU'
!* (!)		(james)		(darren)	Use Darren's LineEditor 2.74
!* (%)		(james)		(lenny)		HelpData for, eg, help_word, lists sF3 for hex entry mode. This is wrong. Check other key references in CDOWN, CUT, ESCAPE, EXECUTE, KEEPREGION, LEARN, QUOTE, mode_basic, mode_taskwindow, mode_c, mode_c++, mode_java, mode_assembler, mode_pascal, mode_halfword, mode_byte, mode_doubleword.
!* ()		(james)		(james)		Source fixes to ZapPS for internationalisation et al, replacing binary patched version
!* (%)		(james)		(m sackman)	TypesLow vs TypesHigh documentation should say 'user choices go in TypesHigh'
!* (!)		(james)		(reuben thomas)	Emacs keymap lists 0x1c as "Delete" not "<-|"
!* (%)		(james)		(lenny)		FINDID help mentions FIRSTBLOCK (which no longer exists).
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Darren's extension 'util' keymap (in ZapUser:Config.UK.Keys) has a binding for FIRSTBLOCK. What's replaced it?
!* (* NewMail)	(james)		(lenny)		Claims it's an HTML colouring mode in its helpdata.
!* (Redraw)	(james)		(james)		lnum colons on, lnumwidth 1 should print '*' (dec) or '>' (hex), not the RH character of the line number
!* (!)		(darren)	(darren)	DeepKeys and support, with latest core build
!* (!)		(darren)	(darren)	ZapEmail 0.25 test 4
!* (!)		(david)		(david o'shea)	ZapMan 0.12
!* (* ZapEmail)	(james)		(various)	ZapEmail should _not_ have a Basemap c-var (or its own basemap should be much closer to the default)
!* ()		(james)		(james)		Paul Nolan has supplied RISC OS 4-like icons. By default we just use the new ic_zap - Resources.400.Extreme contains the full set.
!* ()		(james)		(darren)	Move DUMP on menu to below File->Print, rather than on the Print menu itself
!* (* ZapSpell)	(james)		(b veasey)	ZapSpell not beeping in SAYT
!* (Redraw)	(james)		(justin)	Control characters at the cursor in the selection get the wrong colour.
!* (* HoTMeaL)	(james)		(james)		HoTMeaL keys file is weird (I think this is just a random line of cronk - kill it).
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		HelpData stuff for Zap's icon/windows is partly out of date. I'm thinking the info window etc. isn't entirely useful ...
!* (Boxes)	(james)		(james)		Iconising a dbox on a menu doesn't clear its "I'm on a menu" flag, so uniconising it means you have a leaf window you can't close (without reopening the menu and then closing that).
!* (!)		(james)		(jerome)	Fixes to template sets
!* (* ZapMJE)	(darren)	(rp lund)	MJE function browser code, at least in C mode, aborts.
!* (Boxes)	(james)		(james)		WC prints 'match' instead of 'word'.
!* (! Menus)	(james)		(a wingate)	Menus refers to ZapCode:MakeMenus not ZapCode:Tools.MakeMenus
!+ (!)		(james)		(james)		Switch to get MenuConf to read options from start of MakeMenus output file
!* (CreateWind)	(james)		(james)		If Zap gets an error early in creating a window block (try configuring a non-existent font?), you get "Bad error block!"?
!* ()		(darren)	(darren)	MakeMenus needs rebuilding. I can't rebuild here because my RISC OS gcc is funted.
!* (* JRF)	(justin)	(james)		Build ZapJRF again (sans unnecessary crap), and put back in the distribution in zmods2
!+ ()		(james)		(justin)	New Boxes, Fletcher template set
!+ ()		(james)		(chris egan)	Added ZapPython mode
!+ ()		(james)		(james bursa)	Added 08x20 Latin2 font
!* (+ Code)	(darren)	(darren)	Deletions in a module header in code mode actually put words into the undo buffer.
!* ()		(darren)	(james)		SENDSEL doesn't 'escape' 0 and 128-255 as mentioned for OS_Byte 138
!* (KeyBits)	(darren)	(james)		Key codes we don't understand should be passed to Wimp_ProcessKey, possibly in process_converted_key.
!* (* HoTMeaL)	(james)		()		Checked over the buttons checking they look feasible with current commands.
!* (Mode11)	(james)		(james)		Set filename on create throwback doesn't work any more ... ?
!* (!)		(james)		()		Translations for Germany. (Core.) Richard doesn't have time; have to hack up something containing bits of English for the new sections.
!+ (* Spell)	(james)		(james)		Sort out with new Throwback system
!+ (!)		(james)		(james)		Extension intl changes v1.42 to v1.44: some modes have lost Win-Wrap in Menus (but we're not translating these). Remaining diffs are for ZapEmail, ZapText, ZapUtil and have gone to Jerome.
!+ (+ Throwback)(darren)	(darren)	Make colouring instance-configurable
!* (Keys)	(darren)	(james)		RO 4 reserves 1C0, 1C1 for logo and menu keys. Darren has proposed a remapping which seems sensible (convert_key or whatever in s.KeyBits).
!+ (%)		(james)		(james)		Keymap stuff: named keymaps, per-extension keymaps ...
!+ (%)		(james)		(james)		Menus source file and generation documentation.
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Update thanks, make sure all contact info's up to date
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Proof-read the manual _again_. Check in particular that the Menus references are right.
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Check that internationalisation mentions France and Germany country-specific resources.
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Make sure that Clone mode inheritance is right - check code / with Darren.
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Run through the manual on really recent things - halfword, doubleword, stuff like that.
!+ (%)		(james)		(james)		!Install / install chapter: talk about DDEU_Patch, Boot:Choices.PreDesk.Country, upgrading
!+ (%)		(james)		(glyn, james)	Upgrading notes for v1.40 -> v1.45. Take from FAQ.
!+ (%)		(james)		(james)		Mention Darren's ports of the GNU textutils wrt the filtering commands
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Change variant information: we no longer support RISC OS 2.
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Create clone appears to list core modes in black, clones in blue, others in grey. If so, document this. Otherwise, figure out what's going on :-)
!+ (%)		(james)		(james)		chapter 5 (mouse) doesn't document alt+shift+menu or ctrl+click?
!+ (!)		(jerome)	()		Translations for France. (Core plus various important extensions.)
!+ (!)		(james)		(james)		Program to ease choosing MakeMenus options?
!+ (!)		(james)		(james)		Default renamed to OldStyle. Salt with colours. Default = Salt without colours, and is default.
!+ (!)		(james)		(james)		Move MakeMenus, MakeExtern, Technical, KillDAreas inside ZapCode:Tools. Check that nothing references it (don't think they do).
!+ (+ Throwback)(james)		(james)		Throwback title used sensibly throughout
!* (Commands)	(darren)	(darren)	Problems with OSCLI. (Titlebar set incorrectly.)
!* (* ZapText)	(james)		(james)		FILTERSEL overflow bug
!* (* Spell)	(james)		(james)		Colouring at the top of throwbacks isn't always right. Short-term, needs ZapSpell to behave itself. See later for Darren's proposed extension to throwback to make this better.
!* ()		(james)		(tim)		Remove debug beeps in cln_readc and others ... Zap, ZapBASIC, ZapSpell
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Drop 2D templates, drop RISC OS 2 support.
!* (!)		(james)		(richard smith)	TeX mode keymap predepends on TeX_sp and TeX_de being set, which doesn't happen. Set them in !ZapTeX.!Setup.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		!Zap.!Run/!Zap.!Boot talk about ZapUser:Choices.Country, not ZapUser:Config.Country ...
!* (!)		(james)		(tim)		Should be using latest FlashCar (Reuben's one) -- check that I have the right version ...
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Remove non-updated templates files (or update them)
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		ZapUser:Config.Country shouldn't set Zap$Country in the default setup. In fact, it should unset it to make sure.
!* (!)		(darren)	(reuben)	Macros box should refer to the search dbox, not the manual, for escape sequences
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Menus file should _not_ read "Be tolerANT", but "Be tolerant".
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Get !Messages.Types right -- check again when we build, though
!* (!)		(james)		(james)	        Re-translate Salt template set using Default as a guide.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Default template set is now 'Salt', not 'Default'. Confusing, but true. Fix colours in Salt.
!* (!)		(james)		(darren)	Minor optimisation to removelf sed(1) script. Actually, James may do some more here now he understands sed properly.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Move ZapJRF into zmods2.zip? It isn't very important anymore ... stuff in ZapUser that it depends on?
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Remove ExternalO files from all extensions.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Remove 'Window wrap' menu options wherever they exist. (Scheme, Asm, BASIC, Inform?, CSV?)
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Will we need to internationalise TMFs? If so, set the TMF using the extension path, not the directory.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Internationalisation structure for all extensions. (Note that this requires alterations to some extensions ...)
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		TMFs go into ForZap, not Messages as they should.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		If we have ZapModules:<ext>.<country>.Messages, it doesn't go into Messages.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		New versions of ZapBASIC (1.36), ZapCSV (0.05), ZapAsm (0.06), ZapScheme (0.03)
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		ZapScheme sprites are missing!
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		All extensions should have the standard directory structure. Currently some don't.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Don't bother distributing source in the core distribution.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		ZapSpell v0.16 - I've hacked it, but we need to do v0.17 from source with the internationalisation issues.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Put JRF_SETFILETYPE into ZapUtil and remove from ZapJRF.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		JRF unnecessary commands: JRF_RUNFILE (OPENFILE), JRF_NOTIFY (NOTIFYUSER), JRF_BRACKET (BRACKETCURSOR), JRF_BRACKETSEL (BRACKETSEL), JRF_DROPMARK (DROPMARK), JRF_HELPWORD (HELPWORD), INSERTFILE. Belongs in zmods2.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		JRF_IF(<break><cond><break><then><break><else>) can be replaced by IF (@WORDSTR = "<cond>"):THEN:<then>:ELSE:<else>:ENDIF.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Either kill ZapJRF, or get a working version without the crap.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Where's the Texture colouring mode gone? Does anyone care? (If 'yes', new version 1.14 from source.)
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		New Buttons (0.56), Desc (0.28), HoTMeaL (0.84), Obey (0.43), Perl (0.16), DS (0.34), NewMail (1.12)
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		ZapTMT is dead (functionality now in ZapBits): check sources, menus, keys and scripts for mentions of TMT_POWERSEARCH, TMT_MOUSETRAP and TMT_EVENT, all of which lose the TMT_ prefix.
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Make a list of which extensions still need internationalisation coding (eg: MJE).
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		MakeFile ExternCmd file called it "Makefile"; recent MakeExterns won't recognise this. External file then needs to be rebuilt.
!* (!)		(james)		(iain truskett)	HoTMeaL: STARTOP/STOPOP instead of STARTOPERATION/STOPOPERATION
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Remove TOICON, SENDURL* from ZapDS (in Bits). SENDURLGIVENOFSFSET deprecated - removed code which uses it from NewMail (ClickSend does the same job anyway).
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Update ForZap command etc. list?
!* (!)		(james)		(james)		Rebuild Menus from source once options confirmed with Darren.
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		MakeMenus help file listed define as -d not -D
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Docs.KeyStrip up to date? Also note that the v1.42 keymap needs frobbing to deal with KEYMAPN not KEYMAP, and to sync. back to the new keystrip (F11 gets used, for instance :-)
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Copyright - GPL so add Copying (I hope :-), Boxes.
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Update/remove all !ReadMe files. Modules.!ReadMe needs playing with.
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Comment that word #2 of mode config is going to be changed completely in the next version, and does nothing now. In tech docs somewhere?
!* (%)		(james)		(darren)	Add !Help, !Sprites*, Templates, Messages, ExternCmd, Keys, TMF to files in an extension section; also only one module per extension. Talk about internationalisation (done in !Setup - see !ZapEmail)
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		Changes
!* (%)		(james)		(james)		b28-b31 of doubleword configuration?
!* (%)		(james)		(reuben)	Spell check all help data

*  Bugs
* (%)		()		()		Advising people that binding cC to COPYSEL:CLEARSEL causes problems in TW mode. Not quite sure where to put this ...
* ()		()		()		'Altersel at end' fudge doesn't yet work with mouse-drag selection, nor SELREGION selection for that matter...?
* ()		()		()		'New View', when issued from the icon bar, with taskwindows and throwback buffers behaves differently from when issued from a main window. (Cursor doesn't get set - is that the only problem? Also with regular files)
* ()		()		()		Auto-clear of selection with two views doesn't work properly
* ()		()		()		Bug when combining src1 & src2 and then saving - probably there for ages!
* ()		()		()		Ctrl-select clicking removes cursor mark ?
* ()		()		()		DOS trying to remove 0x0D's?

.  Fixed bugs
. (!)		(darren)	(darren)	Line numbers submenu should be WFORMAT_TOGGLE 8 (possibly remove 'None' option as this will duplicate it)

. ()		(james)		(james)		Selection->Process causes redraw to go wrong in selection?
. ()		(james)		(james)		Extensions build under Unix as well (basically just needs new Makefiles ...) - although AS can't yet build Text/s/help ...
. ()		(james)		(james)		Out Of Memory crashes badly when using dynamic areas. A few MOV instructions had been changed to MOVS, and some overly-conscientious optimisations of VS handling ...
. (* BASIC)	(darren)	()		The directive 'align' in lower case letters isn't coloured correctly, although the upper case version is.
. (* BASIC)	(darren)	(chris bell)	BASIC doesn't recognise the TRUE in FNget_set_int(w%,i%,a*n%,TRUE) as tokenised, due to * preceding?
. (* BASIC)	(darren)	(gareth mcc)	DEF FNf(x)=1*SIN(x) doesn't tokenise SIN. Other functions also affected; doesn't occur with +-/ instead of *.
. (* BASIC)	(darren)	(gareth mcc)	"b :" gets coloured as assembler branch. "B&1234" doesn't.
. (* Diff)	(james)		(james)		e_prevline/e_nextline to force complete redraw when first char changed
. (* Diff)	(darren)	(james)		Context diff support, rcs and ed recognition
. (* ZapBits)	(james)		(james)		Acorn-style makefile for ZapBits is wrong; it always relinks (use more like Text, Util which work properly)
. (* ZapJRF)	(james)		(darren)	!ZapJRF.Keys needs to be renamed !ZapJRF.JRFKeys (and is out of date anyway; either delete or update)
. (* ZapMJE)	(darren)	()		C mode's preprocessor indenting. Also its comment indenting; both wrong in various ways. I *think* this is fixed.
. (* ZapMJE)	(darren)	(james)		ZapMJE doesn't play at all well with Throwback any more. It uses Zap_AddLinkEntry instead of using the higher-level throwback interface; this is evil. We _really_ need a new maintainer for ZapMJE.
. (* ZapRedraw)	(james)		(gary lee)	anti-aliased fonts aren't always freed. ZapRedraw wasn't freeing the bold italic variant of its outline font in VDU mode ...

. (+ Throwback)	(darren)	()		Adjust on title of file removes whole throwback of that file.
. (Boxes)	(darren)	(andrew wingate)TotalSel box gets termination totally wrong, exposing original static buffer text.
. (Boxes)	(darren)	(james)		MZAPBOX - end < start causes fatal error, via out of memory - which may also be implicated
. (Boxes)	(darren)	(james)		GotoBox, ReplaceBox don't look up zap_m_hist into "History" when building their menu titles. Minibuffer also.
. (Boxes)	(james)		(james)		WC bug: run while box is still open, eg: use learned sequence. Get 'Invalid Window Handle'. I've fixed this before; I think it's the Wimp not noticing that its current menu has been deleted; possibly do that first?
. (Boxes)	(james)		(stefan bellon)	Save updates filename even if aborted (to CSD, older, etc.). s.CreateFile:save_to_file calls new_file_name; probably need an f_proposed_name used in preference to f_name until the save is completed, then copy in?
. (Commands)	(darren)	(c granville)	Disc navigation commands don't set grey
. (Commands)	(darren)	(various)	We need an ALLMODES variant which doesn't set to ib context, to replace ALLMODES(MAKEDEFAULT) with something that works
. (Commands)	(james)		(james)		FORMATTEXT stops if an unbreakable line exceeds the wrap width
. (Commands)	(james)		(james)		TOTALSEL should respect Escape, and use hourglass.
. (Commands)	(james)		(james)		WRITEFILE: writes directory into prompt, not into minibuffer
. (Commands)	(james)		(james)		Escaping from WHILE loops was causing a data abort.
. (Cursors)	(james)		(tim)		long, > width, last line, selecting by dragging a selection downwards 'off' the LHS doesn't select any of last physical line. Actually caused by y-line clipping in find_offset. Now returns EOF for clicks beyond EOF.
. (Cursors)	(james)		(tim)		long, > width, last line, selecting by dragging a selection downwards after a triple-cick, doesn't select any of the last logical line. See similar bug.
. (Cursors)	(james)		(tim)		Change cursor type doesn't update immediately
. (Fonts)	(james)		(gary lee)	Encoded fonts aren't ticked. Matching code now rewritten to cope with encodings etc. - uses Font_FindField on RO >= 300.
. (Fonts)	(james)		(james)		font loading code appears broken for substyles in v1.41
. (Keybits)	(darren)	(m somerville)	Keymap files with lines starting "& "
. (Menus)	(darren)	()		Keyboard shortcuts in menus are not always aligned correctly ...
. (Menus)	(darren)	()		ck/ shortcut reads k/
. (Menus)	(darren)	(stefan bellon)	Load menu is broken in v1.41; loading a mode from it removes most of the entries in the menu
. (Menus)	(darren)	(stefan bellon)	Undo enabled, Read only, DOS text file, Spool file no longer get ticked when enabled ... (v1.43)
. (Menus)	(darren)	(various)	Menu auto-sizing on RISC OS 3.[01] wasn't working properly.
. (Menus)	(darren)	(various)	Keyboard shortcuts aren't appearing on menus? Think this has been fixed ...
. (Modes)	(darren)	(james)		The new clone dbox lists (loaded?) clones twice as possible base modes.
. (Modes)	(darren)	(james)		Hide greys out only when the clone is selected, not when the dbox is opened. Delete is never greyed out.
. (Modes)	(james)		(darren)	Ought to check through one last time for hard-coded mode numbers in the core modes.
. (Minibuffer)	(darren)	()		Clicking in the minibuffer doesn't position the cursor
. (Minibuffer)	(james)		(james)		Minibuffer never gets its length in a window right. Actually ... new feature to force the width to that of the parent window; otherwise uses min(template width, window width).
. (Printing)	(james)		(reuben)	Quick print of lines 1-60 of a 1148 line file, but the "60" was ignored; it seemed that it was going to print the whole document.
. (Redraw)	(christian)	(justin)	A positive left window margin with a font narrower than it (or something like that) causes redraw to be blank. The new ZapRedraw (v0.40) will fix this.
. (Softwrap)	(james)		(james)		Now works on the last line in the file, even when that isn't terminated. Also uses w_cr rather than having 0xa hard-coded.
. (Softwrap)	(darren)	(ray dawson)	'->' tab display character is displayed as a space if softwrap is on
. (TMFs)	(james)		(james)		Seems to fall over sometimes, usually on multiple reads of the same variable ... this is always HelpSearchPath ... d'oh, stupid bug in ZapText's help system.
. (Wimp)	(darren)	(gary lee)	Invert the palette - LH margin isn't redrawn (RO 3.11)
. (Wimp)	(james)		(gary lee)	DataSave to Zap doesn't set up modified system properly; '*' is in window, but can close without prompt, and <insert><undo> removes '*'.
. (Wimp)	(james)		(gary lee)	DataSave sends filetype = &FFD for untyped, not -1 as it should. An extra flag to Zap_SendDataSave deals with this (done automatically if filetype not specified).
. (Wimp)	(james)		()		Datasave to Zap doesn't seem to set focus either (iff RAM xfer). It possibly shouldn't do, but since all other injects do we'll stick by it.

/  Not really bugs

/ (Printing)	(james)		()		Fancy Print - Escape - Close window - machine locks. Can't duplicate; assume it's been fixed.
/ (Search)	(james)		(reuben)	Replace (and, in fact, other dialogue-based searches) don't work forward from cursor, but from the next character. Confusing at start of the file, but there's no easy solution - and we have a "from start" option ...
/ (Search)	(james)		()		search for '"xxx'...? Pardon? Until someone explains what this means to me, it'll have to stay here ...
/ (Wimp)	(james)		(tim)		Ctrl-SELECT on window's close icon really kills...? Doesn't it?
/ (Undo)	(james)		()		UNDOing to the start of a file does not alter the "modified" file flag. Seems okay ...

\  Unfeasible suggestions
\ (* TaskW)	(james)		()		Set default e_compile/save and run etc to save then Filer_Run in a TW? This is done: e_saveandrun saves and Wimp_Task's, e_compile saves and Wimp_Task's in a TW. Filer_Run isn't appropriate in this case anyway ...
\ (+ Throwback)	(james)		()		Linenumbers above &A000000 are coloured wrong...? Seems to be a bit higher ... but anyway this is fairly irrelevant.
\ (Keys)	(darren)	()		No keys file entries for Alt-key combinations or PgUp/PgDown Major issues with keyboard handling here ...
\ (Commands)	(darren)	()		FINDFILE's tab in a TW takes account of Prefix$Dir... inserts it, but there are issues with MULTICOMMANDS if we set Prefix$Dir for Zap itself ...
\ (Search)	(james)		()		Search forwards and then click another window.  'Previous' search string is used to find next match - this has been reported as being irritating. <= abort i-search not updating stored search string. This is correct.
