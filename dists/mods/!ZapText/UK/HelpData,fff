ADDLF (ZapText - Tim Tyler)
Takes a textual buffer and inserts LFs at the end of every line which would
be soft-wrapped if soft-wrap was activated.  The width which is used is the
current width and not the word-wrap width.  This command is designed to
perform the opposite function to the command REMOVELF.  It is quite slow,
but the hourglass percentage is used and it can be aborted by pressing
ESCAPE.

ADDLFSEL (ZapText - Tim Tyler)
Takes a selection in a textual buffer and inserts LFs at the end of every
line which would be soft-wrapped if soft-wrap was activated.  See also ADDLF.
This command is designed to perform the opposite function to the command
REMOVELFSEL.  The action is related to that of the FORMATTEXT command.
It is quite slow, but the hourglass percentage is used and it can be aborted
by pressing ESCAPE.

BRACKETCURSOR (ZapText - Justin Fletcher)
Brackets the word in which the cursor sits with the strings given.
Parameters : <break><left string><break><right string>

BRACKETSEL (ZapText - Justin Fletcher)
Brackets the selection with the strings given.
Parameters : <break><left string><break><right string>

FILTERSEL <command> (ZapText - Paul Moore)
This command takes the selected area of the current file, and feeds it to the
standard input of the given command. The selection is replaced by the
standard output. (In other words, it filter the selection through the given
command.)
 
C-style redirection is used (ie, command <standard_in >standard_out), so only
filter programs written in languages using the Shared C Library are likely to
work.
 
Error messages are ignored.
<Wimp$ScrapDir> is used for temporary files (called Zap-In and Zap-Out).
The command is looked for on your run path, and then on the ZapFilters: path
if it wasn't found. Some useful filters are supplied with Zap.

FILTERBUF <command> (ZapText - Paul Moore)
Filters the entire buffer through the given command. See FILTERSEL.

FINDFILECURSOR (ZapText - Darren Salt)
Look for an object name (file or directory) at the cursor. If successful,
then attempt to load the file or open the directory (as appropriate).

FINDSEL (ZapText - Daniel Wagenaar)
Search for the current selection. The parameter is one of:
  "0","To[ buffer]"			: To buffer
  "1","Next[ match]", "Forward"		: Forward from cursor (next match)
  "-1","Previous[ match]", "Backward"	: Backward from cursor (previous match)
  "2","First[ match]", "[From ]start"	: Forward from start (first match)
  "-2","Last[ match]", "[From ]end"	: Backward from end (last match)
 
(all case insensitive).
 
Note that this parameter used to be numerical; it's now a string. The old,
numerical, arguments are still valid, but must be passed as strings.

FORMATINDENTED (ZapText - Darren Salt)
An indented version of FORMATTEXT. The text must already be indented using
the supplied string; if you specify "\<" you get whatever's to the left of
the cursor.

HELPCONTEXT (ZapText - Martin Ebourne)
Find help for the word at the cursor, using Guttorm Vik's StrongHelp.
Help paths can be configured using the c-var HelpSearchPath.

HELPSEARCH (ZapText - Martin Ebourne)
Freetext search for the supplied string, using Guttorm Vik's StrongHelp.
If there is no supplied string, then find help for the selected text, else
prompt for a word in the minibuffer.
Help paths can be configured using the c-var HelpSearchPath.

HELPSEARCHCONTEXT (ZapText - Martin Ebourne)
Freetext search for the word at the cursor, using Guttorm Vik's StrongHelp.
Help paths can be configured using the c-var HelpSearchPath.

HELPTOPIC (ZapText - Martin Ebourne)
Find help for the supplied string, using Guttorm Vik's StrongHelp.
If there is no supplied string, then find help for the selected text, else
prompt for a word in the minibuffer.
Help paths can be configured using the c-var HelpSearchPath.

INSERTBLANK (ZapText - Darren Salt)
In text modes, inserts a space at the cursor as in !Edit.
In binary modes (byte, word, code etc.), inserts the relevant number of
zero bytes.

INSERTFILE (ZapText - Justin Fletcher)
Insert a file at the cursor. Prefixes allow special functions :
  |  The file will be indented as if typed
  *  The file will be run through GSTrans first - ie you can use
     system variables.
Parameters : [*][|]<filename>

INSERTPIPE (ZapText - Paul Moore)
Pipes the output of a command to the cursor. See FILTERSEL.

INSERTPIPEDBUF (ZapText - Paul Moore)
Pipes the entire buffer through the given command to the cursor. See
FILTERSEL.

INSERTPIPEDSEL (ZapText - Paul Moore)
Pipes the selection through the given command to the cursor. See FILTERSEL.

LINEENDS (ZapText - Daniel Wagenaar)
Replaces all occurrences of CRLF, CR, LF, LFCR by the correct return
character (as set in the Display-> Misc->Return char->‘ submenu). This is
particularly useful when you've copied a text file from an MS-DOS system,
which uses CRLF instead of plain LF.

LOWERCASE (ZapText - Tim Tyler)
Change next character/selected region if there is one to lower case.

LOWERCASECURSOR (ZapText - Tim Tyler)
Change next character to lower case.

PIPE (ZapText - Paul Moore)
Pipes the output of a command into a new buffer. See FILTERSEL.

PIPEBUF <command> (ZapText - Paul Moore)
Pipes the entire buffer through the given command into a new buffer. See
FILTERSEL.

PIPESEL <command> (ZapText - Paul Moore)
Pipes the selection through the given command into a new buffer. See
FILTERSEL.

REM (ZapText - James Aylett)
A completely pointless command which does nothing. May be useful for
commenting scripts or something; I don't know.

REMOVELF (ZapText - Daniel Wagenaar)
Designed to convert text with fixed LFs to text with free line-endings.
Converting back to fixed LFs is done by the ADDLF command.
Note that the action of REMOVELF cannot be undone.

REMOVELFSEL (ZapText - Daniel Wagenaar)
Acts like REMOVELF only acts on the current selection.
Converting back to fixed LFs is done by the ADDLFSEL command.
Note that the action of REMOVELFSEL cannot be undone.

SAVEKEEPSTAMP (ZapText - Darren Salt)
Saves the file immediately (ie. no prompt), but preserving the datestamp.

SELECTUNTIL (ZapText - Tim Tyler)
Selects a region under the cursor. This region is delimited by control
characters or any of the characters in the supplied string. The command may
be used to handle double clicks in files where the default selection routine
is not appropriate. (See Zap_ReturnWord in E-ZapCalls.)

SELECTWHILE (ZapText - Tim Tyler)
Selects a region under the cursor. The parameter is non-delimiters for the
region. (See Zap_ReturnWord in E-ZapCalls.)

SELECTWORD (ZapText - James Aylett)
Selects the word at the cursor, as defined by the current mode.

STRIPCTRLCODES (ZapText - Darren Salt)
Strip control codes. In binary modes, beeps instead.
Either takes a byte argument: STRIPCTRLCODES #<byte> 
  Bit 0 set: strip control codes
  Bit 1 set: ... except for \a, \b and \f
  Bit 2 set: remove everything from soft-EOF
  Bit 3 set: strip top bit set characters
 
or takes a string which evaluates to a numerical mask: STRIPCTRLCODES <mask>
in which bit n set = remove chr code n.
The default is STRIPCTRLCODES #3.

SWAPCASE (ZapText - Dominic Symes)
Swap case of next character/selected region if there is one.

SWAPCASECURSOR (ZapText - James Aylett)
Swap case of next character.

SWAPCRLF (ZapText - Daniel Wagenaar)
Exchanges CR <-> LF (Carriage returns with linefeeds). This can be used to
convert Mac style texts to RISC OS style texts, or to convert spooled output
(with LFCR) to 'DOS style' text (CRLF).  This may then be converted to
an ordinary RISC-OS style text by dragging it to Zap's icon bar icon.
This command has been written to replace LINEENDS where possible. It is
*much* faster. The action of SWAPCRLF can not be undone using the undo
commands. It's action may be reversed by executing it again.

UNSPACE (ZapText - Dominic Symes)
Remove excess spacing around the cursor. Note that this now works atomically
(ie it can be undone in one go).

UNTABIFY (ZapText - Darren Salt)
Converts tabs to spaces (the reverse of STRIPSPACES 4).
In program source modes (C etc.) tabs in quotes "" are left intact.

UNTABIFYSEL (ZapText - Darren Salt)
Converts tabs to spaces within the selection, provided that the selection is
in the current window.
In program source modes (C etc.) tabs in quotes "" are left intact.

UPPERCASE (ZapText - Tim Tyler)
Change next character/selected region if there is one to upper case.

UPPERCASECURSOR (ZapText - Tim Tyler)
Change next character to upper case.

@FNHELP (ZapText - James Aylett)
This is a temporary command to allow StrongHelp lookup via a function call.
It may be called as a function, returning NULL (the 0 pointer) if e_help
fails to return anything useful, or "" (the zero-length string) otherwise.
If called as a command, it will act as a call to HELPCONTEXT.
 
Basically the idea is that this (and FNHELPSEARCH) will disappear in the
future, when it's possible for a Zap command to have an optional string
argument in a future-proof way (there's a method at the moment which I'm
against using in extension modules). In the future you'll be able to use
HELPCONTEXT and HELPSEARCHCONTEXT as functions to do this duty.

@FNHELPSEARCH (ZapText - James Aylett)
This is a temporary command to allow StrongHelp search via a function call.
See FNHELP for more information.

@SELECTUNTIL (ZapText - Tim Tyler)
Returns the region under the cursor. This region is delimited by control
character or any of the characters in the supplied string. (See
Zap_ReturnWord in E-ZapCalls.)

@SELECTWHILE (ZapText - Tim Tyler)
Returns the region under the cursor. The parameter is non-delimiters for the
region. (See Zap_ReturnWord in E-ZapCalls.)

@WORDOFFSTR <offset> (ZapText - James Aylett)
Returns the word at (cursor+offset) as a string.

@WORDSTR (ZapText - James Aylett)
Returns the word at the cursor as a string.

#HelpSearchPath (ZapText)
The help search path used with StrongHelp by the HELPCONTEXT, HELPTOPIC,
HELPSEARCH and HELPSEARCHCONTEXT commands and the @FNHELP and @FNHELPSEARCH
functions.
