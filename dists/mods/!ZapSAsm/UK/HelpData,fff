INCVERSION
This command increments the version number of the current file.
In other words, if the leafname is Source5‘ then it‘s changed to Source6‘.
This wraps round, so File9‘ becomes File0‘ (rather than File10‘).

INCANDSAVE
Increments the version number of the current file and then saves it
under the new filename.

DECVERSION
Decrements the version number of the current file.
In other words, if the leafname is Source35‘ then it‘s changed to
Source34‘.  This wraps round, so File000‘ becomes File999‘.

DECANDSAVE
Decrements the version number of the current file and then saves it under
the new filename.

LOSECARET
Removes the caret from Zap.

LISTLABELS
Searches for uncommented labels in the current file.
It simply begins a search for the string \<\( \|\I\)\*.\.\.\*‘.

WORDWORKS
Sends the Impulse method NewRegion‘ together with the current selection
(in Zap) to all Impulse tasks.  If you have Computer Concepts‘ WordWorks
application loaded, this message is recognised by it, and it will try to
find the word/phrase in the dictionary/thesaurus.
If there is no selection in Zap, this command will have no effect.

WOSCLI
Sends its string parameter to OS_CLI (via Wimp_StartTask).
(Note that Zap‘s OSCLI‘ command works differently; it sends the *command‘s
output to a scrapfile, and then opens a window on that file.
WOSCLI on the other hand just shows any vdu output in a regular
non-multi-tasking WIMP command window.)
