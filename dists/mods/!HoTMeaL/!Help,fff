1.0 Features
============

Extensive syntax colouring of the 'inside' of HTML tags.  Full support
for HTML 3.2 tags (AFAIK).

ZapHoTMeaL supports an extensive and very useful button bar.  Documentation
about button bars in general may be found in the ZapButtons archive.

ZapHoTMeaL's implementation contains a useful facility which is not normally
visible to the user: dropping an HTML document into the button bar creates a
link to it from the currently selected region in the document. Similarly
dropping in an image file creates an image link.  As Andy Ward's "Image Size"
utility has been incorporated into ZapHoTMeaL, dragging an image into its
button bar will also insert the height and width into the resulting HTML
image tag.  A warning will be given if the image is corrupt.

There is an extensive, context-sensitive command completion option.  This
acts in a similar manner to Zap's BASIC mode.  Pressing the full stop key
when entering commands completes the current command.  The command chosen is
context sensitive to some degree, further reducing the number of keystrokes
required to enter any given command.

There is support for Darren Salt's ALT/CTRL double click protocol for
fetching URLs.

ZapHoTMeaL supports ZapSpell.  When a spelling mistake is located in a
document the user is not prompted if the word is preceded by an "&", or it is
inside an HTML tag.

There is Beautify option which forces the displayed case of recognised
commands.

The Zap SAVEANDRUN and RUN commands now start up a new task and execute the
file, loading it into a browser.

It is possible to customise the module to add your own tags and attributes.

Cursor key enhancements stolen from Martin Ebourne's modes (see later).

ZapHoTMeaL shares a number of features with my ZapObey mode and you are
referred to this as a further source of relevant documentation.


2.0 Installation
================

Copy the !HotMeaL directory into !Zap.Modules, and restart Zap.

3.0 What it does and does not do
================================

Automatic links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dropping an HTML document into the button bar creates a link to it from the
currently selected region in the document.  Similarly dropping in an image
file creates an image link.

Normally the right type of link is created automatically.  However the user
can control which type of link is used by pressing CTRL if an image link is
required, and SHIFT if a document link is needed.  The latter can be needed
sometimes when creating links to image files, rather than embedding these in
the HTML document.

Dragging an image into the button bar will also insert the height and width
into the resulting HTML image tag.  Thanks are due to Andy Ward for the code
that performs this function.

There is a "lowLinks" option which, if selected, forces the case of any
automatically created links into lower case.  This should be of use to those
negotiating combinations of DOS discs and unix servers.

Command completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The context-sensitive command completion acts in a manner which will
be familiar to users of Zap's BASIC mode.  Following a protocol which
was probably originally laid down by Acorn in its BBC BASIC, pressing the
full stop key when entering commands completes the command.

The command chosen is context sensitive to some degree.  The command
completed will be the first one which matches the given prefix in the most
appropriate one of the three relevant lists of commands which are stored at
the end of the module.  This table is no longer strictly alphabetical to
allow the most appropriate command to be allocated to short abbreviations.

This list is not yet fixed, and may be subject to changes in future
versions of the module.  If changes are to be requested, now is the best
time to ask for them.

Closing tags are added if these are required, as are "="s at the end of
appropriate attributes.  These options may be controlled from the mode menu.
Some people might want to switch them off as they can take a little getting
used to.

The context sensitivity could in principle be greatly improved.  For example
in an <IMG> tag, "h." should normally expand to "href=" unless there has
been one of these already, in which case it should probably turn into a
"height=" attribute.  Similarly "a." would normally expand to "align=", but
"alt=" might be more appropriate if there have already been two "align="s.

Entity completion has also been implemented.  This works along very similar
lines.  When using entity completion a case sensitive match is attempted
first.  This is in order to distinguish between entities which differ only
in their case.  If no match is found, a case insensitive match is then
attempted.

The entity and command completions are considered to be single insertions
and can consequently be undone by a single UNDO operation.  It is useful to
remember this when learning what the minimum abbreviations for commonly used
commands are in the mode.

Processing
~~~~~~~~~~
The commands offered by the mode include a number of facilities which can
be of use when massaging HTML documents.

These include commands to help with converting raw text files into HTML and
other commands designed to strip out HTML tags from documents.

Note that all these commands only perform modifications within the currently
selected region.  They may all be undone by using the UNDO commands.

The HTML stripping functions are broken down into a series of modular
sections which may be used independently of one another.  The button bar in
the mode offers these individually, and also a "Total strip" button which
does its best to convert the entire selected region into a textual form.

The main limitations are as follows:

  * Ordered lists are not catered for and there is no indentation of
    unordered ones : "<LI>" is simply replaced by "* "
    
  * There is no attempt at representing the formatting of tables in the
    resulting document, nor are the ALIGN options treated.  Any CENTER, LEFT
    or RIGHT tags are also completely ignored.
    
  * Currently, any existing linefeeds or carriage returns are left in the
    file.  Stripping these out would not be difficult, but this should only
    be done outside any preformatted regions.
    
  * Zap does not yet offer the option refraining from modifying the
    hourglass percentage display during its search routines; this means
    the percentage display during stripping is often not very meaningful.

Misc
~~~~
ZapHoTMeaL supports ZapSpell.  When a spelling mistake is located in a
document HoTMeaL prevents a prompt being given to the user if the word
is preceded by an "&", or it is inside an HTML tag.  The former sorts out
at least well formed entities.  Note that the latter condition means that the
contents of META tags are *not* spellchecked, nor are the ALT attributes to
the 'IMG' tag.  Also note that no effort is made to determine if the word in
inside a large-scale HTML comment, or is inside a <STYLE> ... </STYLE> or
<SCRIPT> ... </SCRIPT> structure.

There is a "Beautify" option which can be ticked just off the mode menu.
Setting this forces the displayed case of recognised commands to make the
file more legible.  It does not affect the file, just the way it is
displayed.

There is a "Chars" option which highlights quotes, "&"s,  ">"s and
top-bit-set characters so these may be easily seen and eliminated.

There is bracket matching for opening and closing tags.  This is not
especially useful, but can provide feedback about when a tag opening has
been omitted.  There is also an option for entities; this is probably of
even less use.

Upper and lower case forcing options are available for those who
prefer their HTML to be formatted in a particular way.  Case forcing
controls both the "Beautify" option and the command completion facilities.
It does not affect the insertion commands used by Matthew Hambley's HTML 
mode. At the moment, commands on buttons use upper case.  This can be 
changed by editing the 'Scripts' file.

When editing HTML in Zap some users may find they benefit from the use of
alternative keymaps.  This is currently left to the user's discretion.
HTML keymaps by Andrew Ward, Justin Fletcher and Matthew Hambley are
freely available.

The normal rules of thumb apply when using the syntax colouring as a syntax
checking tool: if it colours it correctly, that does not mean it will
actually do what you want it to.  If it colours it wrong, then there are
good grounds for examining the code closely; there is quite likely to be a
problem with it.

Comments are most welcome on this mode - details on where to send them to can
be found at the end of this file, in the "contact" section. Please do not
send messages informing us that that SGML comments are parsed incorrectly,
or that multi-line comments display badly. We also aware that the 
specification of HTML indicates that CRs have very little significance, but
HoTMeaL mode is currently sensitive to these being placed unusually. These
problems will be addressed in due time.


4.0 Customisation
=================

It is possible to add new tags to ZapHoTMeaL in a similar way to the manner
in which ZapObey supports additions to the list of commands it understands.

An attempt has been made to program this module in a manner which makes it
as easy as possible for users to alter the list of commands which it
recognises and highlights.

The list of recognised tags is stored at the very end of the module. 
There is no user-interface provided for changing this list, but the module
is hacker-friendly and if you are reasonably confident about what you are
doing and find that there are some tags which the module is consistently
not recognising, (and the module is not being  maintained properly...) then 
it is possible to simply load the module directly into an editor, and change
the list of recognised tags directly.

All three alphabetic lists of tags may be edited.  The start of each table
MUST remain word aligned.  The tables are scanned from the first entry to
the last within each alphabetic entry.  New commands should normally be
inserted such that their initial letter lies an appropriate place in the
alphabetic list.

The order of the commands within each letter of the alphabetic section
affects which command is chosen by the command completion routines.  Earlier
commands take precedence over later ones.

The list of entities is currently best left well alone...

Having said this, the best thing to do is send a report of the missing table
entry and send it to the mailing lists - see the Contact section at the end
of this file.


5.0 Hacking
===========

The module is programmed so that other programs that offer functionality
associated with massaging HTML can read the options currently in use.  It is
anticipated that this will be most relevant for HTML macro style programs.

The mode's current options are stored &24 words in from the start of the
module, just after its header.  Before being loaded, the word contains
-1.  In use, bits 27-21 reflect the state of the items off the mode menu.

Bit 27 - Make "Beautiful" ... Bit 18 - Add trailing "="s.

When the menu items are selected, the relevant bits are set.

Note that this word is effectively read only.

There are a few configuration options wired into the module which may be
altered by those wishing to customise the module for their own requirements.

&28 bytes in from the start of the module, lie a couple of bytes which are
used to control various settings:

&28: this controls the delay in centi-seconds the <> tag matching pauses for;
&29: the delay in centi-seconds the &...; entity matching pauses for;

Both these default to &18.

Sorry that these options do not yet have any proper front end.


6.0 Licence
===========

This module is Freeware, and may be distributed freely provided that all the
files remain together and intact.


7.0 Problems and Plans
======================

Fix problems with multi-line comments which contain the '>' character.

Possibly highlight links...?

Possibly add colouring support for some scripting languages, CSS etc.

Implement an intelligent completion routine for the "<?" key sequence which
automatically closes the last relevant open tag.

Entity stripping is very, very slow.

Improve the intelligence of the command completion context sensitivity.


8.0 History
===========

v0.86 - (29-Aug-02)
      * Fixed a bug which could cause redraw crashes under certain
        circumstances. This has altered comment rendering behaviour for
        the worst, and hopefully we'll be able to fix this properly in
        the future.

v0.85 - (22-May-01)
      * Buttons changed to use click not release for things that want to
        check the mouse state (currently the change button bar icons)
      * Fixed startup bug if Buttons enabled (LFto00 code was making
        invalid assumptions about the file loading code - file loading
        code fixed to preserve speed of LFto00 code)

v0.84 - (27-Sep-99)
      * Updated for Zap v1.45.

v0.83 - changelog lost

v0.82 - (08-Oct-97)
      * Dragging images into the button bar of a window with selected text
	now inserts an 'IMG' tag with the selection as its 'ALT' text.
      * Bugfix for an RPC-specific stability problem introduced by the
	multi-line comment code present in v0.81.

v0.81 - (26-Jul-97)
      * A few new tags added.
      * HTML tags split across multiple physical lines are now coloured
	correctly.  This includes quoted sections which may also be split
	across more than one line.  The code is not perfect, but should
	now make colouring mistakes very rarely.
	Note that the above changes mean that colouring of script languages
	may be worse than before as these contain '<' and '>' symbols in
	non-tag contexts, and the adverse effect of these is no longer
	confined to a single physical line.
      * Some support for multi-line comments.  These are correctly supported
	given the proviso that the comments do not themselves contain any
	'>' characters.  Overcoming this limitation may prove to be
	difficult for the author.
      * The display of comments modified so the beginning '<!' and end '>'
	are no longer highlighted.  This was more aesthetically pleasing,
	but less technically correct.
      * Proper (nearly) SGML comment colouring supported.  Comments run
	inside sections starting with a '<!' between odd and even numbered
	'--' markers.
      * Stack space for the HTMLSTRIPENTITIES command increased - hopefully
	this should make the command operate more reliably.

v0.80 - (24-Jun-97)
      * Added support for ZapSpell.  This means that HTML documents can be
	spell-checked without complaints about 'HREF' being an unknown
	spelling being generated.

v0.79 - (12-May-97)
      * Added a SoftWrap option to the mode.  Note that this needs the
	latest version of the SoftWrap mode to function correctly.

v0.78 - (07-Apr-97)
      * Added 'list of functions' entry point so the LISTFNS command now
	produces a list of the headers in the HTML document.  This simply
	uses an appropriate search.  A corresponding button has been added to
	the button bar.
      * Cured a problem with drags in the selection routines not being passed
	on, giving an unresponsive feel.

v0.77 - (05-Apr-97)
      * Andy Ward's "Image Size" utility has been incorporated into
	ZapHoTMeaL.  This means that dragging an image into its button bar
	now inserts the height and width into the resulting HTML image tag.
	A warning is given if the image is corrupt.  Many thanks to Andy for
	contributing his code.
      * An extension to the selection code means block-selecting a simple tag
	or entity now selects the surrounding < and > or & and ; - this is
	more often what is required.

v0.76 - (03-Apr-97)
      * Pressing and holding down ESCAPE now forces command completion not to
	happen so you will always get a '.' when you type it.
      * Double-clicking on a file now uses the BLOCKUNTIL command which means
	the resulting selection will usually be more sensible...
      * A few new attributes added.

v0.75 - (20-Mar-97)
      * HTMLADDALTTEXT command added.  This provides support to the other
	stripping commands.
      * HTMLSTRIPENTITIES command added.  This (pretty much) reverses the
	effects of the HTMLENTITY command.
      * HTMLSTRIPSCRIPT command added.  This strips out any cascading
	style-sheets, Javascript or other scripting languages found in the
	document.
      * Darren Salt's SENDURLGIVENOFFSET command is now being used.  This
	means ZapDS 0.29 is now required for correct operation of this
	command.

v0.74 - (16-Mar-97)
      * HTMLINSERTIF command added.  This provides the ability to define a
	context-sensitive " key which inserts "&quot;" when not inside a tag.

v0.73 - (09-Mar-97)
      * Added the HTMLSTRIPCOMMENTS and HTMLSTRIPTAGS commands.
      * Extended the button bar to provide better support for these.
      * Added the Menus file, and attached this to the button bar.

v0.72 - (03-Mar-97)
      * Added the ability to insert links and images complete with unix-
	style paths by dragging HTML and image files into ZapHoTMeaL's
	button bar.
      * "Image" and "Link" buttons make more sensible (by avoiding the
	minibuffer).
      * Added the "lowLinks" option.  This forces the case of any
	automatically created links into lower case.  This should be of use
	to those negotiating combinations of DOS discs and unix servers.
      * Added configuration options for the addition of ">"s and "="s when
	completing tags and attributes.
      * Support added for Darren Salt's ALT/CTRL double click protocol for
	fetching URLs.  This works by calling Darren's command directly.
	The capabilities and behaviour of this option will will be the same
	as in the Email mode.
      * Modifications to cope with the new syntax of the BUTTONS_CHANGE
	command.

v0.71 - (02-Mar-97)
      * Added the ability to insert links and images complete with unix-
	style paths by dragging HTML and image files into ZapHoTMeaL's
	button bar.
      * "Image" and "Link" buttons make more sensible (by avoiding the
	minibuffer).

v0.70 - (24-Feb-97)
      * Buttons support improved, and the QUOTE tags replaces the BR tag
	there.

v0.69 - (22-Feb-97)
      * &...; sequences in comments were being coloured incorrectly.
      * Buttons support improved.

v0.68 - (18-Feb-97)
      * Rare bug in the options code cured.
      * A minor decrease in size.

v0.67 - (17-Feb-97)
      * Sorted out a bug in the HTMLENTITY command's handling of the '>'
	character.
      * Complete rewrite of the code used to store and save the options.
	This means that any existing saved settings will be lost.
      * Added primitive support for Buttons with a consequent increase in
	the module's size.

v0.66 - (14-Feb-97)
      * Added support for Netscape's 'layers' tags and their attributes.
      * Added support for Netscape-style bookmarks.
      * Cured bug when editing in linewrap mode which caused some editing
	sequences at line ends to crash Zap.

v0.65 - (08-Feb-97)
      * Extended the linewrapping code to make sure that entities split over
	lines are correctly coloured.

v0.64 - (07-Feb-97)
      * Tags and attributes now wrap properly. The routines responsible for
	the colouring of entities have not been treated with the therapy
	that produced this effect yet.
      * Bug causing some entities to be displayed incorrectly if the user
	inserted or deleted characters to the right of their first character
	fixed.
      * Incorrect entities are no longer highlighted as unknown. This can
	make them more difficult to spot, but it is more in line with the
	spirit of HTML.
      * 'Illegal' characters in the first column of files can now be
	highlighted correctly.
      * Made checking for the '&' character (slightly) more intelligent in
	the HTMLENTITY command.
      * v0.63 was probably unstable if the 'Pretty' menu option was ticked.

v0.63 - (06-Feb-97)
      * Significant improvements made to the way tags which wrap around
	the screen are coloured.  The left-hand side of the screen should
	now always be coloured correctly.  This was the worse of the two
	sides.  Correcting the right-hand side correctly is more
	complicated, but will hopefully get done at some point.
      * The display of entities split across physical lines has been
	similarly improved.
      * A number of miscellaneous colouring bugs and problems were wrinkled
	out while making the above change.
      * A minor change in the command completion's context sensitivity which
	should offer slight improvement.

v0.62 - (03-Feb-97)
      * Renamed the HTMLENTITY command to HTMLRAWENTITY.
      * Added a new HTMLENTITY command. This replaces all occurrences of
	characters in the currently selected region which should not be
	included in HTML documents with their entity equivalents.  In
	contrast to HTMLRAWENTITY it pays attention to the contents of tags
	and any existing entities and SGML comments when performing its
	changes and leaves these alone.  Between them these two commands
	provide most of the functionality of a text to HTML converter from
	within Zap.

v0.61 - (01-Feb-97)
      * Added the HTMLENTITY command.  This replaces all occurrences of
	characters which should not be included in HTML documents with
	their entity equivalents.  It only operates on the currently selected
	region.
      * Comments which are split over lines (though still not multiple-line
	comments) should now be coloured correctly.
      * Command completion now no longer pays any attention to the character
	under the cursor when operating, except when deciding whether to
	add trailing '>', ';' or '='s.
      * Instances where command completion operates when outside tags should
	now have been completely eliminated, though it will still act when
	inside comments.
      * Cases where pressing the full-stop key causes Zap to act as though
	it was in overwrite mode should now be fixed.

v0.60 - (30-Jan-97)
      * SAVEANDRUN should now work properly.

v0.59 - (28-Jan-97)
      * Problem causing a crash if the cursor was on the last character of
	the file, and a command completion was attempted.
      * The context sensitivity of the command completion routines is now
	aware that "/c." sequences commonly occur in paths and no longer
	tries to complete commands if the full stop key is pressed inside
	paths.

v0.58 - (24-Jan-97)
      * Syntax colouring of entities described by ASCII values improved
	by making it more lenient, so it should now work properly.

v0.57 - (20-Jan-97)
      * A bug causing the third element in many structures to not be
	coloured correctly, fixed.  This problem crept in around v0.53.

v0.56 - (19-Jan-97)
      * A bug emerged which caused insertions of multiple character strings
	to be corrupted by the routines which performed bracket matching.
	Multiple strings of characters are no longer sent to these routines.

v0.55 - (17-Jan-97)
      * Alphabetic entities are now treated by the syntax colouring routines
	and coloured appropriately.
      * Command completion no longer attempts to complete commands which
	have already been completed.

v0.53 - (12-Jan-97)
      * Cured RPC specific problem with starting from blank files in
	ZapHoTMeaL.
      * Entity completion made more sensible when only one letter has been
	typed.
      * Trailing "="s, ">"s and ";"s are no longer added when the character
	after the insertion point contains that very character.

v0.52 - (12-Jan-97)
      * Added hacky configuration options.
      * Extended command completion to add ">"s to the end of a number of
	simple tags.
      * Entity completion added using internal entity list.

v0.51 - (11-Jan-97)
      * Extensive and very useful context-sensitive command completion added.
      * Upper and lower case forcing options added.  These affect both
	the "Beautify" option and the command completion.

v0.50 - (07-Jan-97)
      * The "Chars" option highlights quotes, "&"s,  ">"s and top-bit-set
	characters so these may be easily identified and eliminated.
      * Bracket matching for "< ... >" pairs.  This is not especially useful,
	but can provide feedback about when a tag opening has been omitted.
      * Start entity matching on entity completion.  This is less useful
	than the tag pair matching, but some people might like it.
      * These options may be turned on and off from the mode menu.
	They all default to off.  They are controllable for each window
	independently, and it possible to save their default options to
	disc as normal.
      * !DOCTYPE declarations and similar entities are displayed in a more
	orthodox manner.

v0.49 - (06-Jan-97)
      * The Zap command "OLEFILECHANGED" was added in error and then quickly
	stripped out again (apologies).

v0.48 - (09-Dec-96)
      * Cured logical line numbering difficulties.

v0.47 - (28-Nov-96)
      * Added support for the tags Microsoft introduced in fairly early
	versions of their internet explorer.  Some of these tags have
	succeeded in becoming more widely adopted.  Notable are, the MARQUEE
	tag and its friends, BGSOUND, video extensions, multi-coloured table
	backgrounds, background properties, PLAINTEXT, and even some
	speculative alternative image tags that are not at all widely
	supported yet.
	For the amusement of readers, ZapHoTMeaL offers support to the
	"MouseOver" value of the 'Start' attribute (used to control when
	video images start to roll).  Quite how Microsoft ever expected an
	archaic and, completely illogical reference to a twentieth-century
	input device to find its way past an international document standards
	authority, into the specification of HTML, goodness only knows.
	The giggles from Apple's trackpad users can almost be heard...

v0.46 - (21-Nov-96)
      * Comments have now gone completely eco-friendly.
      * !DOCTYPE declarations and their relatives are no longer coloured
	as comments.  The way they are at the moment is far from perfect,
	especially when it comes to "![" things, but it makes more sense
	now than it did before.

v0.45 - (19-Nov-96)
      * Grungy fix for tags within comments ending the comment incorrectly.
	Comments must end with something like "-->" to be coloured correctly.
	This may get done properly some day, but for the moment it improves
	the display.

v0.44 - (10-Nov-96)
      * Fix for RPC owners who use Zap with dynamic areas: a problem
	sometimes occurred when SHIFT left-arrow was pressed at the
	start of a file, or SHIFT right-arrow at the end of one.  I
	have applied the solution to this problem to all my modes.

v0.43 - (08-Nov-96)
      * Made ZapHoTMeaL ambivalent about whether there are spaces on either
	side of '=' signs within tags when performing its colouring.

v0.42 - (05-Nov-96)
      * Got hold of the W3C HTML 3.2 spec from
	"http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/WD-html32" and supported every tag,
	attribute and attribute value contained therein.  This document is
	a bit wishy-washy (and it does not even conform to its own spec) and
	I still do not have a proper specification for the units attribute.
      * Got hold of the "The bare bones guide to HTML" by Kevin Werbach from
	"http://werbach.com/barebones/" and included all the tags and
	attributes found there.  This includes Netscape's extensions included
	in version 3.0 of their browser, including support for frames and
	Java.
      * The down side to all this is that the new tags eat up extra memory.
      * Parameters to 'Name' attributes are no longer ignored and are now
	coloured like the opening and closing mark-up tags.  This also
	applies to 'HRef=', 'Background=' and 'Src=' attributes which are no
	longer marked as unknown tags if their parameters are unquoted.
      * Minor bug involving incorrect colouring of sequences like:
	"&lt;test;" where the "test" was coloured as an entity fixed.
      * Triple alphabetic index now implemented to improve speed.
      * Internal revamp of the format so that markers are used to mark the
	beginnings of the three tables.  This means all the tables may now be
	easily edited by third parties if they feel the need to do this to
